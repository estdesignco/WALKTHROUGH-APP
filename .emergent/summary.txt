The trajectory details a challenging development journey for an interior design application, oscillating between ambitious feature development and persistent debugging. Initially, the AI engineer tackled a broad set of features, but user frustration quickly narrowed the focus to a functional furniture search app and real (not mocked) third-party integrations, particularly Houzz Pro and scraping vendor sites.

Key challenges involved correcting fundamental architectural misunderstandings, like MongoDB database and collection names ( vs. ,  vs. ), and repeatedly addressing the user's demand for real functionality over simulations. The AI engineer successfully implemented an end-to-end flow for single-item scraping from vendor sites (e.g., Four Hands) without credentials and added products to the correct furniture database. A major pivot occurred when the user provided vendor spreadsheets, shifting the scraping strategy from direct wholesale site scraping to a hybrid approach (spreadsheet data + retail site images for safety).

The current critical issue, a recurring theme, is the failure of product images to display correctly in the frontend, despite the AI engineer's previous assertions of success. The price on request issue for products was also reported by the user, immediately after the AI engineer claimed it was fixed. The AI engineer is now at the point of re-diagnosing the image display problem by checking the database content for the images.

The overarching goal is to create a robust interior design management application to streamline a designer's workflow. The initial vision included:
1.  **Customer-facing Questionnaire:** Email-based, beautiful UI for clients to detail project needs.
2.  **Designer Landing Page:** Auto-fills from questionnaire.
3.  **Contact Sheet:** Manages all project contacts.
4.  **Walkthrough Sheet:** Mobile-app interfaced, offline-capable, pre-loaded with rooms/items, ability to add/edit/delete, take photos/measurements (Leica D5 integration), and sync data.
5.  **Checklist (Curation Phase):** Advanced spreadsheet features, item scraping from links (product name, size, color, link, image, SKU, cost), status dropdowns linked to pie charts, Teams integration for to-dos, Canva board integration for links, and transfer to FFE. Crucially, a dream feature for a unified search engine for all furniture sites.
6.  **FFE (Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment) Sheet:** Offline-capable, app-interfaced, pictures/measurements, live shipping tracking, order dates, status dropdowns for installation.

The immediate and evolving focus shifted significantly to:
*   **Ultimate Furniture Search App:** A single interface to search all vendor catalogs, consolidating product information (from provided spreadsheets) and images (scraped from retail sites). This requires full IP protection (VPN, proxies) during scraping.
*   **Advanced Product Display:** Large images, zoom functionality, and color variation selection for items in the furniture search.
*   **Real Houzz Pro Integration (Paused):** The ability to automatically clip items to a user's Houzz Pro account, saving them to the ALL PRODUCTS project. This needs to be a real, automated browser process, not a simulation.
*   **Hybrid Scraping:** Parse vendor spreadsheets for data (SKU, price, name) and scrape *retail* websites for product images to avoid legal/vendor relationship issues.
*   **Comprehensive Catalog Processing:** Ingest thousands of products from multiple vendor spreadsheets (Four Hands, Uttermost, Rowe, Burnhardt, Loloi) with specific handling for fabric variants, finishes, and sizes.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI for building the RESTful API endpoints.
-   **Frontend:** React.js for the user interface, styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid and beautiful UI development.
-   **Database:** MongoDB, utilized with the  library for asynchronous operations, maintaining distinct collections for projects, rooms, categories, and multiple furniture product catalogs.
-   **Web Scraping & Automation:** Playwright (Python) is extensively used for headless browser automation, including anti-bot techniques, for extracting data from websites.
-   **Data Processing:** Python's  for parsing Excel spreadsheets (vendor catalogs).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure with backend and frontend services.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the primary backend file, containing FastAPI routes, database interactions, and business logic for core features.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**
        -   Overhauled  to use Playwright for link extraction and correct database schema. (Though later deprioritized).
        -   Modified  from a simulated function to an attempt at real browser automation (later identified as still mocked and paused).
        -   Introduced and refined  to handle URL scraping, item creation, and an attempt at real Houzz Pro integration.
        -    and  endpoints were added and debugged, exposing two distinct furniture data systems.
        -   Extensive debugging for database connection (e.g.,  mismatch) and MongoDB  serialization.
        -   Integration of IP protection (VPN/proxies) was planned but the implementation details are in separate scripts/functions not fully integrated into  yet.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Stores critical configuration, including ,  (which was ), and credentials for Houzz Pro and Gmail.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** No direct changes, but correct usage and understanding of  were crucial for debugging.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages interactions with the  collection, used by the  endpoint.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Modified to use the correct  database. Added  to string conversion for JSON serialization.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains API routes and logic related to the  system and the  collection in the  database, which the frontend actively uses for stats and product display.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** New routes and logic were introduced to manage the Furniture Catalog system, distinct from the main Furniture Search system, which required adding products to this specific collection for frontend visibility.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Stores the , crucial for frontend API calls.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** None.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Main frontend entry point, orchestrating the rendering of major components.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Integrates  component.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core React component for the Ultimate Furniture Search App UI, handling search, filters, product display, and gallery features.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**
        -   Updated to fetch and display products from the  collection (via  and ).
        -   Initial product loading logic was fixed (in ).
        -   Image display logic was modified, including attempts to increase image size ( changes) and address non-displaying images.
        -   Pricing display logic was adjusted to correctly use the  field from the backend.
        -   Enhancements for multiple images gallery, zoom, and color variation selection were added but are still under active debugging as of the last message.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix Image Display:** The primary and most urgent task. Ensure actual product images (scraped with SKUs) are consistently displayed in the frontend, rather than generic placeholders or no images.
-   **Implement Advanced Image Gallery:** Fully enable and debug the requested features for multiple images, zoom, and lightbox functionality in the frontend.
-   **Implement Color Variation Selection:** Provide UI and backend logic for users to select and view different color options for products.
-   **Implement Full IP Protection:** Integrate VPN rotation, proxy chains, request delays, and IP address masking into the scraping logic.
-   **Scale Catalog Processing:** Continue processing all remaining vendor spreadsheets (Four Hands, Uttermost, Rowe, Burnhardt, Loloi) to populate the furniture catalog with thousands of products.
-   **Finalize Real Houzz Pro Integration:** Address the login and saving issues for the Houzz Pro clipper (currently paused in favor of furniture search).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in a critical debugging loop regarding the display of images and pricing within the Unified Furniture Catalog frontend. Despite previous claims of successful image display and pricing fixes, the user's latest feedback (Chat 441, STILL no images!) indicates these issues persist.

Immediately prior to this request, the AI engineer had:
1.  **Fixed initial product loading:** The  component was updated to ensure products load correctly on the initial page display (Chat 409-415).
2.  **Adjusted image aspect ratio:** Attempted to make images larger by changing the  to a more rectangular ratio in  (Chat 416-417).
3.  **Addressed Price on request:** Identified that the frontend was looking for a  field while the database used , and updated test products with valid  values. The  function was also improved (Chat 423-436, ).
4.  **Restarted frontend:** After these changes, the frontend was restarted (Chat 438).

However, the user's explicit report of STILL no images! (Chat 441) and implicitly, still Price on request (Chat 422) indicates that these fixes have not fully resolved the visual issues for the user. The AI engineer's immediate next step (Chat 442) is to investigate the database to understand the actual state of the image data stored for the products, specifically whether the  fields contain valid base64 data or appropriate URLs.

<optional_next_step>
Check the database for the specific products to confirm the presence and format of the image data (base64 or URLs).
