The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a complex project from an initial clone to a feature-rich application, meticulously adhering to stringent user aesthetic requirements. The work began by rectifying core application setup issues like missing backend dependencies () and incorrect import paths (), which restored backend functionality and project loading across dashboards. A significant portion of the effort focused on UI/UX, starting with precise logo adjustments on the Studio Dashboard and extending to a comprehensive implementation of a luxury black/gold/cream theme across all customer-facing pages and internal dashboards (, , ). This involved iterative styling of gradients, text colors, and component layouts, with a critical emphasis on preserving existing functional color schemes within spreadsheet data. Challenges included managing React component syntax during large-scale refactors and debugging data retrieval to ensure rooms and items appeared correctly within dashboards. The engineer also provided modular code for main header and container components, anticipating future integration needs. The work concluded with the user proposing a new task: building a unified search engine.

<product_requirements>
The user, an interior designer, sought a sophisticated application to streamline project management, requiring an enhancement of an existing app. The core problem was to evolve the application's aesthetic to be slick and amazing with a dark and moody foundation, focusing heavily on a luxury black/gold/cream theme.

Explicit requests and implemented features include:
1.  **Email Questionnaire System**: An elegant email template and a beautiful customer-facing landing page leading to a detailed questionnaire. This questionnaire was later expanded with lifestyle and project-specific questions.
2.  **Logo Integration**: Prominent display of a provided PNG logo across all interfaces, with specific instructions for size, color (black letters against a gold gradient), and minimal padding.
3.  **Studio Dashboard & Spreadsheet Views (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE)**: Application of the luxury theme to internal dashboards while *strictly preserving* their existing structural and functional color coding for rooms, categories, and item statuses. This also included making spreadsheet containers much wider to accommodate extensive data.
4.  **Add Room Functionality**: The ability to add rooms with headers and items, and visualize their appearance within the spreadsheets using distinct room colors and color-coded item statuses.
5.  **Data Population & Backend Integration**: Ensuring the backend API correctly returned nested rooms and items for project dashboards, allowing full visualization of project data.
6.  **Container Styling Consistency**: All content containers (status panels, search controls, spreadsheet areas) within dashboards to adopt a darker black-to-gray-900 gradient and rounded treatment, while retaining the specific, muted header colors for each dashboard.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a MERN-stack like architecture, with a React frontend and a FastAPI (Python) backend using MongoDB.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend application, defining API routes, models, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include  import. The  GET endpoint was updated to return nested  and their , with a fix for accessing MongoDB  field within the query.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles Google Sheets integration routes.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed relative import paths (e.g.,  to ) to resolve backend startup errors.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Added  (with version correction) to resolve a missing module error.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main dashboard for studio management.
    -   **Changes**: Initially received extensive styling for black/gold/cream theme. Logo size and padding were significantly increased and adjusted to be much larger with minimal padding. Code for its header, main container, and email modal was later extracted into separate files (, , ).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Spreadsheet-like component for walkthroughs.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed React  errors by adding null checks to , , . Received comprehensive luxury theming (darker gradient backgrounds for content, preserved muted headers), widened containers (), and had its header structure restored.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed a significant phase of work focused on modularizing and extracting core UI components. Specifically, the engineer provided the user with the complete code for three newly created components: , , and . These files encapsulate the desired luxury black/gold/cream styling for the header, navigation, and primary content containers, designed to serve as wrappers for existing spreadsheet components. Additionally, the engineer extracted and provided the full code for  and  into new files ( and ) to fulfill a user request for these specific codebases.

The application is currently in a state where:
-   All primary dashboards (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE) are functional and styled with the black/gold/cream luxury theme, including wider containers, color-coded status panels, and working Add Room functionality (though the  library is temporarily disabled in FFE).
-   Backend APIs are returning complete project data, including nested rooms and items.
-   Headers on Walkthrough and Checklist dashboards have a muted gold theme, while the FFE dashboard specifically retains its original colorful header.
-   The extracted components represent a clean, modular foundation for future development by other agents.
