The AI engineer's trajectory commenced with debugging and implementing core features, inheriting an initial setup. Early efforts focused on resolving a non-functional Transfer to FFE button, which revealed that while items transferred, their statuses did not, and navigating FFE pages caused full reloads. This led to a significant refactor to replace  with state-based updates, ultimately requiring scroll position restoration due to persistent jump issues. A critical frontend routing bug in  was identified and fixed, ensuring proper navigation to specific project sheets.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to PDF import and scraping. The AI engineer addressed initial scraping failures due to incorrect Playwright browser paths and missing vendors in the  list. Categorization logic for imported items was enhanced, and a major issue with  breaking project loads was fixed with robust data validation and database cleanup. However, persistent problems with scraping incorrect wholesale prices and page refresh issues (including a problematic service worker) led to escalating user frustration and multiple debugging attempts. Despite numerous fixes to login flows, vendor mapping, and front-end routing configurations, these core problems remained unresolved, ultimately prompting the user to pivot to the mobile app and Leica D5 integration.

<product_requirements>
The application serves as a comprehensive interior design management system. Key features include:
1.  **Customer Questionnaire**: Email-sent, beautiful UI for room/project details, auto-populates designer landing page and contact sheet.
2.  **Walkthrough Sheet**: Pre-loaded from questionnaire, mobile/offline support, interfaces with mobile app, features for adding/deleting/rearranging rooms/items, taking photos/measurements (Leica D5 integration), syncs to Checklist.
3.  **Checklist Sheet**: Supports item scraping from links (name, size, color, link, image, SKU, cost), status dropdowns feeding a pie chart, Microsoft Teams notifications on status changes. Status Complete should be READY FOR PRESENTATION.
4.  **FFE Sheet (Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment)**: Bible for designers, mobile/offline support, on-site picture/measurement, live shipping tracking, order dates, status dropdowns. Status Complete should be READY FOR INSTALL.
The UI structure, colors, and operations are paramount and must not be altered without explicit instruction. The dream is to scrape all furniture sites into one place.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a lengthy and highly iterative debugging process for two critical, long-standing issues: inconsistent page refreshing/routing in the frontend and inaccurate scraping of product data (specifically wholesale prices, sizes, and finishes) from vendor websites like Loloi Rugs and Visual Comfort.

For the **page refresh issue**, the engineer systematically investigated and attempted fixes involving  routing order, replacing , implementing scroll position restoration, experimenting with , configuring  in , setting , and finally, attempting to completely disable and bypass the  (service worker) which was identified as a persistent caching and routing interference. Despite these efforts, the issue continued to manifest as pages redirecting or going white on refresh, leading to significant user frustration.

For the **scraping issue**, the engineer debugged:
1.  **Browser executable path**: Fixed Playwright path in .
2.  **Vendor detection**: Enhanced  and made logic more permissive.
3.  **Credential storage and usage**: Set up a  MongoDB collection and implemented login logic in  in , including replicating a previously working  method and addressing database name mismatches.
4.  **Wholesale price loading**: Added waiting strategies after login and, most recently, identified and implemented logic to handle Trade buttons or modal logins, as explicitly requested by the user, for sites like Loloi and Uttermost.

Despite numerous attempts, including real-time logging and manual Playwright testing, the scraper continued to return sample prices (8) and generic sizes (Oversized) even after successful login attempts. The user expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the lack of progress on both these core functionalities, leading to a pivot away from these tasks.

The **current work** has just shifted. The user explicitly requested to move on to something else and get back to the **mobile app with the Leica D5 integration**. The AI engineer has acknowledged this pivot and has begun to investigate the existing codebase related to the  and  components to understand their current status.
