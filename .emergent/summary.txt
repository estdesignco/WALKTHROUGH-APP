The previous AI engineer's work has been primarily defined by the user's strict insistence on exact code replication for the application's aesthetic and functional components. The trajectory began with clarifying which version of the newly introduced Unified Furniture Search engine should be used, leading to the identification of the advanced code base in . Work shifted to integrating the precise versions of the core spreadsheet components (FFE and Checklist) from this directory, a process marred by component mix-ups that angered the user. Specifically, the Checklist implementation was found to contain FFE code. After fixing the spreadsheets and facing continued criticism that the Customer Questionnaire was also incomplete, the user provided a complete, final code package for the customer landing page, questionnaire, and email templates in the last message (Chat 93). The engineer's immediate next step is to apply this comprehensive replacement package without modification, as explicitly demanded by the user, to ensure aesthetic and structural fidelity before proceeding to the complex back-end integrations.

<product_requirements>
The core requirement is a technologically advanced, robust interior design project management system with a luxury black/gold/cream aesthetic.

1.  **Customer-Facing Flow:** Sending an email containing a link to a BEAUTIFUL questionnaire (now a detailed, multi-section form) that captures client, project, design, and lifestyle information.
2.  **Designer Sheets:** The questionnaire data must automatically populate four core project sheets:
    *   **Walkthrough Sheet:** Must support offline use, mobile app interface, pre-loaded room/item structures, dynamic editing (add/delete/rearrange rooms/items), picture taking, and measurement tools (planned Leica D5 integration).
    *   **Checklist Sheet (Curation Phase):** Must feature all dynamic editing from the Walkthrough, support item scraping from links (populating name, size, cost, image, SKU), status tracking (linking to a pie chart), integration with Canva, and sending To-Do tasks to Microsoft Teams.
    *   **FFE Sheet (Final Phase):** The project Bible, requiring offline support, picture/measurement tools, **LIVE SHIPPING TRACKING**, and order date management.
3.  **Unified Furniture Search Engine:** A major, recently introduced requirement: a central, single-view search platform to scrape and display products from multiple vendors with advanced filtering. This feature requires real-time integration with Houzz Pro and Canva. All components must use the exact code structure provided by the user.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full Stack:** React.js frontend (Tailwind CSS, advanced component structure), FastAPI (Python) backend.
-   **Data Persistence:** MongoDB (), utilizing project, room, and item schemas.
-   **Integrations (Simulated/Planned):** Web scraping (, , **Selenium** for Houzz Pro), Canva API, Microsoft Teams webhooks, SMTP for email sending.
-   **State Management:** Complex local state management within highly dynamic spreadsheet components (, ).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Tailwind frontend structure. The key architectural decision involves storing complex, dynamic spreadsheet logic directly within highly specific, user-mandated components (e.g., ). The codebase also contains external, comprehensive code packages in adjacent directories that the AI is tasked with incrementally integrating.



**Key Files and Status:**

*   ** (and associated Email components):** This file, along with , , and , is queued for immediate replacement using the comprehensive code package provided in Chat 93. It currently holds the aesthetically correct luxury landing page structure.
*   **:** Currently contains a complex form, but the user insists it is not the complete, newest version. The full replacement is pending. This component includes logic to auto-create , , and starter  entries upon submission, crucial for initial data population.
*   **:** Recently replaced/created using the exact version found in the source directory. This handles the complex FFE lifecycle (shipping, order dates).
*   **:** Recently replaced/created, but suffered a temporary mix-up where FFE code was incorrectly copied. This component handles the Curation phase and scraping/integration tasks.
*   **:** Contains basic CRUD routes for Projects, Rooms, and Items, and includes routers for Google Sheets and the unified search. The item creation logic in the backend must align with the room types selected in the Questionnaire (implemented in the frontend submission logic).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement Latest Code Package:** Overwrite the customer-facing components (, , , , ) with the full, final code package provided in Chat 93.
-   **Upgrade Unified Furniture Search:** Integrate the newer, comprehensive version of the Unified Furniture Search engine and its backend routes/logic from the  directory.
-   **Core Integrations:** Implement actual (non-simulated) functionality for Houzz Pro scraping, Canva API interaction, and Microsoft Teams notifications, as hinted by the existence of files like .

<current_work>
The most recent, active work revolved around correcting the spreadsheet component implementations to match the user's EXACT aesthetic and structure. The AI successfully integrated the user-provided code for both  and , validating that the components load and display project data correctly on the dashboard views (Checklist and FFE views).

However, this process was immediately followed by a user instruction to fix the **CustomerfacingQuestionnaire.js**, which the user claimed was still wrong and incomplete. After an internal search for the most complete version, the user bypassed the search and provided a comprehensive, six-file code package in Chat 93. This package contains the definitive versions of all customer-facing elements, including the full Questionnaire, Landing Page, and Email Template (both React and static HTML).

The task immediately before this summary concluded with the AI acknowledging the critical nature of this final code dump and planning to implement it exactly as provided, addressing the user's explicit mandate for exact structural replication across the initial parts of the application workflow.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the full code package provided by the user (Chat 93) to update the customer landing page, questionnaire, and email templates immediately.
