The trajectory details an iterative development process by an AI engineer. Initially, the focus was on introducing new features like a questionnaire, landing page, and project detail page, alongside styling updates. A significant portion of the work involved debugging and reverting changes, particularly in the FF&E spreadsheet, due to breaking existing functionality while attempting styling. The user repeatedly emphasized maintaining core spreadsheet functionality and applying *exact* designs from provided assets. A major recent achievement was fixing a Failed to fetch error in FF&E by correcting a hardcoded URL and installing Playwright. The current phase involves precisely replicating customer-facing components (landing, questionnaire, project detail) from a user-provided ZIP file, fixing logo issues, and addressing persistent scraping and Canva PDF extraction problems, all while strictly avoiding modifications to existing spreadsheet components. The most recent issue is a frontend loading spinner preventing projects from displaying on the .

The application, a React/FastAPI/MongoDB project, manages interior design FF&E data. The user's primary goal is to expand functionality and fix bugs, strictly adhering to provided designs and *without altering existing spreadsheet functionality*. Key requirements include:

*   **Existing Spreadsheet Preservation:** Crucially, the Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E sheets (colors, format, form, function) are king and **must not be touched at all**.
*   **New Customer-Facing Workflow:** Implement a new customer-facing interface including:
    *   A **Landing Page** () for project management (New Client, Email New Client, Full Questionnaire buttons, project cards with email/delete).
    *   A **Comprehensive Client Questionnaire** () with specific sections (Client Info, Scope of Work, Type of Project, Design Questions, etc.), conditional questions based on Type of Project selection (New Build, Renovation, Furniture Refresh), file upload, room selection, and custom room addition.
    *   A **Project Detail Page** () to display client and project information, with tabs (Questionnaire, Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E), an editable questionnaire tab, and conditional sections.
*   **Exact UI Replication:** Recreate the landing page, project detail page, and questionnaire **EXACTLY** as provided in a ZIP file and screenshots, including all questions, layouts, cells, logos, gold color scheme (), and dark theme styling.
*   **Enhanced Scraping:** Improve the Add Item scraping functionality to be extremely thorough (pick up a speck of dust).
*   **Canva PDF Scraping:** Fix Canva PDF scraping to correctly extract *all* links and items to populate the app.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical issues with the newly implemented customer-facing components, particularly after the user reported that the changes (logos, look, cells) were not reflected and scraping functionality was still broken.

The AI engineer addressed:
1.  **FF&E Loading Fix (completed earlier):** The Failed to fetch error in FF&E was resolved by fixing a hardcoded URL in  and installing Playwright for scraping functionality.
2.  **Customer-Facing Pages Replication:** The AI engineer created and then entirely overwrote , , and  with the *exact* code from the user-provided ZIP file (, ,  respectively), including routes in . This was done to match the user's demand for precise replication and conditional questionnaire sections.
3.  **Logo and Visual Appearance Debugging:** The AI identified and corrected a discrepancy in the logo URL in  which was causing the wrong logo to display on the customer-facing pages.
4.  **Scraping Functionality:** Playwright browsers were installed on the backend to fix earlier scraping failures. Initial tests confirmed basic product page scraping was functional, but Canva PDF scraping issues and the thoroughness of general scraping () remain open.
5.  **Current Problem:** Despite these fixes, the  () is now displaying a **loading spinner** indefinitely, and projects are not being rendered. The backend API () was tested and confirmed to be working, returning project data. This indicates a frontend JavaScript issue preventing the React component from displaying the fetched data. The user has repeatedly expressed frustration regarding this loading issue and asked for an immediate fix.
