The previous AI engineer's work centered on transforming a Google Sheets workflow into a React/FastAPI application, specifically the FF&E module. This involved a highly iterative process, with the user providing detailed, often critical, feedback. Initial efforts focused on UI/UX replication, including a 3-level hierarchy, precise color schemes, and horizontal scrolling. The AI addressed numerous bug reports: fixing color discrepancies (red, purple, gold), resolving scrolling and page-jumping issues, improving link functionality and scraping, cleaning up cell containers, and meticulously adjusting header layouts and button placements. A significant challenge was the user's frustration with the logo placement/sizing and the link scraping functionality. The AI iteratively refined the UI elements, including adding a dynamic logo, ensuring plain text cells, and rectifying scrolling. The core persistent issue, link scraping on JavaScript-rendered wholesale sites, led to the decision to upgrade the scraping mechanism, which is the current focus.

The goal is to replace a Google Sheets interior design app with a web application managing client workflow (Questionnaire, Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E). The FF&E section requires exact replication of Google Sheets UI: 3-level hierarchy (Room > Category > Sub-category), horizontal scrolling, and specific color coding (unique room colors, green categories, red subcategories, brown for additional info, purple for shipping info, and a custom gold for headers/buttons/logo). Features include auto-population of rooms/categories/subcategories, consolidation of small categories (pending), link scraping for product info from 24 wholesale vendors, free-flow editable cells with auto-save, specific 16+ column structure (Item Name, Vendor/SKU, QTY, Size, Orders Status, Finish/Color, Cost/Price, Link, Image, Order Status/Ship/Delivery, Install Date/Shipping TO, Tracking #, Carrier, Order Date, Notes, Delete), date pickers, smart tracking links, a double-sized pie chart status overview with 19 status options and matching colored dots, 18 carrier options, and 24 wholesale vendor options. UI fixes included headers jumping, ensuring a professional muted color palette, removing duplicate shipping containers, and a specific header layout with buttons (Import, Export, Add Room, Delete Room, Move to Selection, Add Item, Add Section, Delete Section) and a custom logo.

    -   **Summary**: Central FastAPI application managing API routes and MongoDB interactions for FF&E data. Contains data models, endpoints for CRUD operations on rooms, categories, and items.
    -   **Changes**: Extended for 3-level hierarchy, updated  enum, , .  (using BeautifulSoup) was implemented and is currently being replaced with Playwright-based logic.
-   **/app/backend/.env**
    -   **Summary**: Backend environment variables for , , and .
    -   **Changes**:  set to .
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**
    -   **Summary**: Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes**:  and  were added for scraping,  (and its dependencies) are pending addition/installation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Summary**: Main React component, handles routing and global layout.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  and passed utility data.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**
    -   **Summary**: Global CSS file for styling the application.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified for a professional, muted color scheme (almost black background, custom gold, red, purple, green, brown), header styling, and to enforce fit-to-text for cells.

    -   **Summary**: Orchestrates the FF&E view, displaying project details, status overview, and integrates the . Manages fetching utility data and room creation.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to include a complex header layout with project info, client details, navigation tabs, a logo container, FF&E title with Export/Spec Sheet buttons, Status Overview, Shipping Carrier Breakdown, Search bar, and various action buttons (Import, Add Room, Delete Room, Move to Selection, Add Item, Add Section, Delete Section). The logo () is now displayed with specific sizing and padding adjustments.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/FFESpreadsheet.js**

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on a critical link scraping functionality, which the user stated was not working despite backend tests showing success. The user explicitly expressed frustration and threatened to cancel the service if this feature wasn't fixed for wholesale sites that use JavaScript to load content dynamically (e.g., Four Hands).

The current state of work involves upgrading the backend's web scraping capability from  (static HTML parsing) to  (JavaScript-capable browser automation) to correctly extract product information (name, price, vendor, image, color, size, description) from modern wholesale websites.

**Key recent actions:**
-   Backend scraping endpoint () was confirmed functional for static HTML.
-   An integration playbook for Playwright was obtained.
-   Playwright imports have been added to .
-   The user provided a specific wholesale URL () for testing the upgraded scraper.

**Other significant recent fixes (leading up to this scraping focus):**
-   **Logo & Header Layout:** The user's specific ESTABLISHED DESIGN CO. logo has been implemented, with meticulous adjustments to its size, container dimensions, and padding to match the user's detailed visual requirements (a wide, thin gold rectangle with large text that fills the container). This was a highly iterative process involving many rounds of feedback.
-   **Scrolling:** Vertical scrolling now works, and horizontal scrolling within the spreadsheet is enabled without triggering browser navigation gestures, although speed concerns were raised again.
-   **Cell Styling:** All data input cells in the spreadsheet now appear as plain text (using  divs or simple inputs) without black box containers, except for date pickers and dropdowns. Cells dynamically fit their text content.
-   **Link Functionality:** Links within the spreadsheet now open in a new tab without causing page jumps.
-   **Action Buttons:** Various action buttons (Add Item, Delete Section) are correctly positioned on the far left of their respective sections.
-   **Color Scheme:** All specified colors (red subcategory headers: , purple shipping info: , gold elements: , green categories) are correctly applied.
-   **Status Overview:** The status breakdown displays all 19 status types with matching colored dots.
