The AI engineer primarily focused on three key areas: web scraping robustness, critical bug fixes related to data transfers, and extensive UI/UX cosmetic enhancements. A recurring challenge was Playwright browser instability, requiring frequent reinstallation, and persistent issues with Four Hands image scraping. The Walkthrough to Checklist Transfer functionality, previously sensitive, was revisited for FFE transfer, where an auto-population bug was introduced and swiftly resolved. Most recently, the work concentrated on a significant UI overhaul, integrating new layout components while meticulously adjusting spacing, shimmer effects, and gold accents based on detailed user feedback. This iterative process involved numerous frontend modifications to achieve a specific aesthetic, often requiring multiple adjustments to spacing and visual intensity. Simultaneously, scraping was a persistent issue, repeatedly reported as non-functional, primarily due to Playwright browser executable issues, and an image capture problem for specific vendors.

The Interior Design Project Management App aims to streamline workflows with spreadsheet modules (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE) and integrations. Key features include: offline-capable Walkthrough for item management and transfer; Checklist with robust web scraping (SKU, name, price, image, size, finish/color), status dropdowns for Teams integration, Canva automation, and a PICKED status checkbox; FFE for live shipping tracking and direct  fields. Rooms should auto-populate with full structures upon creation on all sheets. Cross-cutting concerns demand sheet independence (except for transfers), reliable Walkthrough to Checklist transfer (only *checked* items, default BLANK status), matching UI colors for dropdowns, and correct Add new category functionality. Current implementation includes core APIs, React UI, stabilized data transfer (Walkthrough to Checklist, now also Checklist to FFE), basic web scraping, and UI styling. Recent work focused on fixing scraping, auto-population on room/category creation, and extensive UI refinements for layout, spacing, and a luxury black/gold/cream theme.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two primary issues based on user feedback:
1.  **UI Spacing and Aesthetics**: The user reported that a huge gap still existed between the logo and the graphs, despite multiple attempts to reduce it. There was also a continuous iteration on the shimmer effects, with the latest request being to take it out all together and make gold lines just a little bit thinner, while maintaining brightness. The user also explicitly requested borders around every container and to outline the headers. The AI has removed all shimmer, made lines thinner, and added borders to many containers, and added outlining to headers. The most recent action was an attempt to completely eliminate that gap by modifying  to stack elements with zero space.
2.  **Scraping Functionality**: The user repeatedly reported scrape not working. This issue frequently manifested as Playwright browsers being missing, requiring reinstallation. While basic scraping for fields like name, vendor, cost, size, and SKU has been confirmed as working for sites like Four Hands, the specific problem of capturing the *actual product image* (instead of a tracking pixel or null) for Four Hands and other difficult sites (like Wayfair, CB2 which block scraping) remains an ongoing challenge. The last message confirms scraping is not working again, likely due to the Playwright browser issue.

<optional_next_step>
Reinstall Playwright browsers and then continue to fix the persistent huge gap in the UI.
