The previous AI engineer's trajectory was characterized by an iterative process of debugging and feature implementation, often under significant user frustration due to persistent issues. Initial efforts focused on fixing backend data retrieval (Canva PDF scraping room lookup), resolving frontend JavaScript errors ( on undefined) caused by race conditions and missing data, and correcting widespread hardcoded URLs that rendered most features non-functional across the React application. A key challenge was correctly interpreting and implementing the user's intricate requirements for room, category, and subcategory structures, including dynamic content loading and specific UI displays (e.g., subcategory names as red headers instead of ITEM). The engineer systematically addressed these, relying heavily on troubleshooting agents and direct UI/API testing. The final phase successfully standardized subcategory headers and dynamic category loading across all sheets, culminating in a positive user confirmation before transitioning to new, comprehensive requirements.

The application, a React/FastAPI/MongoDB project, manages interior design FF&E data. The user's core problem was a non-functional MVP with numerous bugs and incomplete features, leading to significant frustration. Explicit requirements and desired implementations include:

-   **Walkthrough Sheet**: Specific headers (), plain text editable cells, red third-row header, and inclusion of FF&E sheet features (colors, buttons).
-   **Checklist Sheet**: Columns . Red third-row header, FFE features, 9 specific color-coded statuses (BLANK, PICKED, ORDER SAMPLES, etc.), and status dropdown feeding this breakdown.
-   **General/Cross-Sheet Features**: Add/restore delete buttons for rooms, categories, and items. Robust Add Item (auto-scraping) copied from FFE. Minimize/expand for rooms/categories. Muted room header colors. Canva PDF scraping to extract *all* links and auto-categorize. All cells plain text editable (except dates/dropdowns). Restore Add Category button. New rooms/categories must load with all subcategories and items. Search/Sort. Fix FFE sheet navigation. Prevent page resets on add/delete.
-   **New additions**: FINISH/COLOR column in Checklist (after SIZE) and corresponding field in AddItemModal. A comprehensive, AI-enhanced room/category/subcategory structure for , replacing generic ITEM headers with specific subcategory names (INSTALLED, PORTABLE, SINKS, FIXTURES, etc.), with subcategories only if 4+ items. Enhanced scraping and thumbnail image expansion.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on correcting critical UI display and data loading issues that led to significant user frustration.
1.  **Subcategory Headers**: The primary focus was to replace generic ITEM subheaders with specific subcategory names (e.g., INSTALLED, SINKS, FIXTURES) in the red table headers across all three spreadsheets (, , ). This involved restructuring the table rendering logic to properly display these dynamic subcategory names from the  structure.
2.  **Add Category Dropdown**: The Add Category dropdown in  was updated to dynamically fetch and display all available categories from the backend  endpoint, resolving an issue where only a few categories were visible or functional. This involved adding a  for  and a  hook to perform the API call.
3.  **Cross-Sheet Application**: The user explicitly requested that these fixes (subcategory headers and dynamic category loading) be applied to *all* sheets (FF&E and Walkthrough), which was the immediate task being completed.

The last successful actions were applying the subcategory header fixes and dynamic category dropdowns to , , and . The user confirmed the  fix was correct (YOU DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).
