The previous AI engineer's work involved an iterative, user-driven development process to transform a Google Sheets-based interior design workflow into a full-stack React/FastAPI application. The primary focus was the FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) module. Initially, the AI debugged a critical frontend rendering issue where backend data was not displayed, eventually identifying a project ID mismatch as the root cause. Subsequent work revolved around precisely replicating the Google Sheets UI, including a 3-level hierarchy (Room > Category > Sub-category), specific color schemes, centered headers, and column placement. The process involved extensive back-and-forth with the user, addressing detailed feedback on layout, missing features (like the link column), dropdown options, date pickers, link scraping for wholesale sites, and granular color adjustments. The AI also implemented auto-population of room structures and integrated tracking functionality. Challenges included persistent UI rendering issues, complex styling requirements, and ensuring all explicit user demands were met despite communication nuances.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a web application to replace an existing Google Sheets-based interior design app. The application should manage a workflow including a client questionnaire, Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment) sheets.

**Key requirements include:**
- Replicating the exact visual layout, color coding (including unique room colors, specific green for categories, red for subcategories, custom gold/brown for additional info, and purple for shipping info), and headers of the original Google Sheets, particularly for the FF&E section, which needs horizontal scrolling.
- Implementation of a 3-level hierarchy for organizing items: Room > Category > Sub-category.
- Features for importing existing data and emailing questionnaires to clients (pending).
- Offline capability for job site usage (pending).
- Drag-and-drop functionality for rooms and categories, with the ability to minimize sections (pending refinement).
- Auto-population of all appropriate categories and subcategories when a new room is created, with default items.
- Consolidation of categories with two or fewer items into another category (pending).
- Link scraping functionality for auto-filling product information (name, vendor, cost, image, finish/color) from product URLs, specifically for a list of 24 wholesale vendor sites.
- Fixing UI issues like headers jumping (fixed) and ensuring a professional, muted color palette with distinct, subtle colors and an almost black background (no white anywhere).
- All cells should utilize free-flow editing (directly editable without an explicit edit button) with auto-save.
- Column headers (ITEM, VENDOR/SKU, QTY, etc.) must be placed on the red subcategory line, beneath higher-level colored sections (Red for core info, Brown for additional info, Purple for shipping info).
- Inclusion of all necessary columns: Item Name, Vendor/SKU, QTY, Size, Orders Status, Finish/Color, Cost/Price, Link, Image, Order Status/Ship/Delivery (with 3 distinct input spaces), Install Date/Shipping TO, Tracking #, Carrier, Order Date, Notes, Delete.
- Date picker functionality for all date fields (Order Date, Install Date, Ship Date, Delivery Date).
- Smart tracking links that auto-open carrier websites based on tracking numbers.
- A status overview section with a double-sized pie chart (with labels as per user's picture) and a status breakdown list, both reflecting real data and displaying unique colors for each of the 19 status options.
- Carrier dropdown functionality with 18 specific carrier options.
- Vendor dropdown functionality featuring only the 24 wholesale vendors provided by the user.
- Removal of duplicate shipping containers in the header.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a comprehensive list of user-reported issues and refinements, mostly related to the FF&E spreadsheet's UI and data handling. The last major set of fixes addressed:
1.  **Color corrections:** Applying user-specified hex codes for room headers, category headers (), subcategory headers (), additional info sections (), and shipping info sections (). The previous red for subcategories was also explicitly changed to .
2.  **Free-flow editing:** Removing explicit edit buttons and making all fields directly editable with auto-save functionality.
3.  **Link scraping:** Ensuring the link scraping functionality for 24 wholesale sites was correctly working and integrated into the , with a clickable Fill button.
4.  **Vendor dropdown:** Corrected to display only the user's specified wholesale vendors, removing retail options.
5.  **Date spacing:** Improving the layout and spacing for the three date fields (Order Status, Ship Date, Delivery Date) within a single cell.
6.  **Navigation issues:** Fixing horizontal scrolling to prevent returning to the previous page and addressing link jumping to the top of the page.
7.  **Missing columns:** Ensuring the Link, Notes, and Delete columns were correctly added to the FF&E spreadsheet.
8.  **Carrier dropdown:** Confirming the carrier dropdown was working with all 18 options.

The AI engineer presented a screenshot confirming these fixes, highlighting the correct colors, free-flow editing, fixed link scraping, proper status breakdown, and improved date spacing. The last action was asking the user if they would like to test the link scraping functionality.
