<analysis>
The AI engineer initiated the project by analyzing a Google Sheets-based interior design workflow and converting it into a full-stack React/FastAPI application. The core task involved replicating the Google Sheet's Questionnaire, Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) functionalities, with a specific focus on the FF&E module.

The development was iterative, driven by continuous user feedback on UI layout, color schemes, and structural hierarchy. Initially, a basic FF&E dashboard with collapsible sections was built, followed by extensive refinement to precisely match the Google Sheet's visual design, including specific column headers, alternating row colors, and a multi-level (Room > Category > Sub-category) organizational structure. Debugging focused on backend API integrity and frontend rendering issues, leading to successful data persistence but ongoing display problems in the UI.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a web application to replace an existing Google Sheets-based interior design app. The application should manage a workflow from client questionnaire to three core sheets: Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment). Key requirements include:
- Replicating the exact visual layout, color coding (including room-specific and item-specific colors), and headers of the original Google Sheets, particularly for the FF&E section, which needs horizontal scrolling.
- Implementation of a 3-level hierarchy for organizing items: Room > Category > Sub-category.
- Features for importing existing data and emailing questionnaires to clients.
- Offline capability for job site usage.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for rooms and categories, with the ability to minimize sections.
- Auto-population of all appropriate categories when a new room is created.
- Consolidation of categories with two or fewer items into another category.
- Link scraping to auto-fill product information and display image thumbnails.
- Fixing UI issues like headers jumping when clicked and ensuring a professional, muted color palette with an almost black background and no white anywhere.
- All cells should utilize fit-to-text sizing.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, using MongoDB as the database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   **/app/backend/server.py**
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application file. Defines API routes for managing projects, rooms, categories, and items within the FF&E system. It interacts with the MongoDB database.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include comprehensive data models and API endpoints for FF&E, supporting the 3-level hierarchy (Room, Category, Sub-category).
-   **/app/backend/.env**
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables for the backend, notably  and .
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, acting as the entry point and handling global layout and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to integrate the  component and manage overall application flow, including initial project creation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**
    -   **Summary**: Global CSS file for the application's styling.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to implement the desired professional, muted color scheme (almost black background, no white), header styling, and to fix the header jumping issue.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/FFEDashboard.js**
    -   **Summary**: Orchestrates the FF&E view, displaying project details, status overview, and integrating the  component.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted for header structure (client header below status overview) and overall theme consistency.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/FFESpreadsheet.js**
    -   **Summary**: A newly created component central to displaying the FF&E data in a spreadsheet-like, horizontally scrollable table, matching the Google Sheets layout precisely.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented to support exact column headers, alternating row colors, cell fit-to-text, and the 3-level hierarchy.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RoomSection.js**
    -   **Summary**: Renders individual room sections within the FF&E dashboard, intended to include collapsible functionality and manage categories.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to support auto-population of categories when a room is added.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/FFESection.js**
    -   **Summary**: Likely handles the rendering of sub-sections (categories/sub-categories) within a room, working in conjunction with .
    -   **Changes**: Updated to correctly display the 3-level hierarchy (Room > Category > Sub-category) with precise color coding.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AddRoomModal.js**, **/app/frontend/src/components/AddCategoryModal.js**, **/app/frontend/src/components/AddItemModal.js**
    -   **Summary**: Modal components for user input to add new rooms, categories, and items respectively.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables for the frontend, primarily .
-   **/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js**
    -   **Summary**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate new theme colors and ensure Tailwind generates the required utility classes.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement link scraping functionality to auto-fill product information and image thumbnails.
- Refine drag and drop functionality for rooms and categories.
- Develop logic for category consolidation (merging categories with two or fewer items).
- Implement offline capability for job site usage.
- Add import/export functionality for project data.
- Fix the frontend bug preventing the display of newly created rooms and items in the UI.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is debugging a critical frontend issue. Although backend API calls for creating projects, rooms, categories, and items are successful (confirmed by  tests and backend logs showing data persistence), the frontend UI is not displaying these newly created entities. The last known state shows a project (Greene Renovation) with data for Living Room, Lighting, and items like Crystal Chandelier and Floor Lamp successfully created in the backend, but the user reported no rooms created, and no example to see on the frontend. The AI engineer has verified that the backend data exists and suspects a JavaScript error in the browser console preventing proper rendering. The FF&E dashboard structure and styling have been updated to precisely match the user's Google Sheets screenshots, including the 3-level hierarchy (Room > Category > Sub-category), muted color scheme, and horizontal scrolling.

<optional_next_step>
Check the browser console and fix the JavaScript error.
