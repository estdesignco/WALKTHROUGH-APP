<analysis>
The AI engineer's work has been an iterative and challenging process, largely driven by the user's persistent demand for exact code replication and specific visual aesthetics. Initial efforts involved copying components from the  directory, leading to backend Pydantic validation fixes to enable project loading. Despite these fixes and functional project detail pages, the user repeatedly criticized the AI for not using the *exact* code, particularly for customer-facing elements. This led to multiple attempts by the AI to copy files from various user-referenced directories (, ), often generating or re-copying form-based components that the user rejected as not having the beautiful room design or actual logo/pictures. The AI frequently claimed successful implementation based on limited testing, only to be immediately corrected. Eventually, the user provided explicit *descriptions* and *image URLs* for a complete system (landing page, questionnaire, email), which the AI then generated. However, this generated code was also rejected. In a confusing pivot, the user provided code for a furniture search engine which the AI began integrating, encountering initial file creation and linting issues. The trajectory concludes with the AI having integrated parts of the furniture search engine while simultaneously requesting the *actual code content* for the previously described complete system components from the user.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a feature-rich interior design project management application with a strict luxury black/gold/cream aesthetic. Key features include a customer-facing questionnaire (emailed link, beautiful UI, captures project/personal info) that auto-populates a designer's landing page. A Contact Sheet for all project contacts is needed. The Walkthrough Sheet is critical, requiring offline capability, mobile app interface, pre-loaded rooms/items, dynamic editing, picture/measurement tools, and data transfer to the Checklist. The Checklist must support item scraping (populating details from links), status dropdowns (linking to a pie chart), To-Do tasks in Teams, and Canva integration. The FFE (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) sheet is a Bible for designers, needing offline support, app interfacing, picture/measurement capabilities, live shipping tracking, and order date cells. A central dashboard displaying project cards with the correct logo and styling is required, along with a Project Detail Page with four sub-tabs (Questionnaire, Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E), demanding exact structural and aesthetic replication. Additionally, a comprehensive furniture search engine with real product data, one-click Houzz Pro integration, Canva integration, and Teams notifications has been introduced.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of integrating a new complete furniture search engine. This involved creating new backend files:  (for Houzz Pro automation using Selenium) and  (defining FastAPI routes for real Four Hands products, Houzz, Canva, and Teams integrations). A corresponding frontend component, , was also created. The AI successfully integrated the  into the main  and created the new files after an initial hiccup where  did not place them correctly.

Concurrently, there's a recurring issue regarding the exact code for customer-facing pages. The user *described* a complete working system (Chat 226) with their actual logo and pictures for the customer landing page, questionnaire, and email template. The AI has now explicitly requested the *actual code content* for these , , and the respective frontend components, as only descriptions and image URLs were provided in the user's latest messages.

<optional_next_step>
Obtain the actual code content for the  system files (landing page, questionnaire, email, backend) from the user.
