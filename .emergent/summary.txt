The AI engineer's work in this trajectory was a highly iterative and often frustrating process of integrating disparate codebases and replicating specific UI/UX designs, primarily driven by user feedback. The initial phase involved merging components from , , and  while addressing  icon issues and basic backend connectivity.

A significant challenge arose from the AI's interpretations of the user's requirements versus the user's demand for *exact* replication from provided GitHub repositories and live URLs. This led to repeated cycles of the AI building a component, the user stating it was incorrect or missing styling/functionality, and the AI apologizing and re-attempting an exact copy based on newly provided live screenshots. The most persistent confusion centered on correctly identifying the dashboard versus the customer landing page and replicating their precise visual styles, including logos, gradients, and interactive elements. The trajectory concludes with the AI still struggling to match the main dashboard's exact design and functionality as intended by the user, particularly regarding clickable projects and overall aesthetic.

<product_requirements>
The user, an interior designer, required a sophisticated application for managing design projects, centralizing product sourcing, and integrating with external tools, all while adhering to a luxury black/gold/cream aesthetic.

Key features, either implemented or explicitly requested:
1.  **Unified Search Engine**: A multi-vendor product search platform, leveraging Houzz's official clipper for mass catalog imports, including secure credential management and advanced filtering.
2.  **Canva & Teams Integration**: One-click product image additions to Canva boards and to-do list integration with Microsoft Teams for staff notifications.
3.  **Customer Questionnaire System**: An elegant email-based client questionnaire with a beautiful customer-facing UI, automatic project creation, and data flow to designer dashboards.
4.  **Core Workflow Dashboards (Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E)**: Advanced, visually consistent spreadsheet-like interfaces for on-site walkthroughs, product curation, and final specification. These demanded *precise* preservation of their original structure, colors, and operations, with offline and mobile app support.
5.  **Main Application Dashboard**: A central hub displaying all projects and providing access to every component of the app, featuring the user's actual logo, correct color scheme, clickable projects, and exact styling/gradient effects from provided live URLs.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central routing and component orchestration.
    -   **Changes**: Has undergone numerous modifications. Initially adapted for merging various features, then repeatedly replaced with the user's  to ensure exact routing. Routes for , , and various dashboard attempts have been added, removed, and re-added, reflecting the ongoing struggle to define the main application's entry point and navigation structure correctly. Currently trying to integrate  as the root.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Intended as the designer's main dashboard.
    -   **Changes**: Initially modified to show projects and various actions. It has been repeatedly re-written, sometimes as a beautiful interior room (customer-facing) and sometimes as a project-listing dashboard (designer-facing), causing significant confusion and user dissatisfaction due to the AI's misinterpretation of its role and visual design.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core unified product search interface.
    -   **Changes**: Initially merged from  and styled. It was later replaced *exactly* with the user's version after explicit instructions, including  and .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core project workflow spreadsheets.
    -   **Changes**: These and their numerous supporting components (e.g., , , modals, sections) were explicitly copied *exactly* from  multiple times, along with all associated UI components, to ensure precise replication of original functionality and styling.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The current main dashboard component.
    -   **Changes**: Created in the latest interaction to attempt to use the *customer-facing landing page design* (beautiful interior room with gold ESTABLISHEDDESIGN CO. text) as the *main dashboard template* while integrating dashboard functionality and navigation links, per the user's most recent and confusing feedback (Chat Message 479, 480).

<pending_tasks>
-   **Finalize Main Dashboard Design**: Accurately replicate the main application dashboard's exact styling, including the correct logo, gradient header, shimmer effects, clickable projects, and overall cohesive look based on the user's live examples (specifically, the  page as the *dashboard*).
-   **Ensure Button Functionality**: Verify all navigation buttons and project cards on the dashboard are fully functional and lead to the correct pages.
-   **Complete Houzz Pro Clipper Automation**: Fully resolve login and product addition issues for Houzz.
-   **Canva API Integration**: Implement actual API calls for Canva to automate product assignment.
-   **Microsoft Teams Webhook Integration**: Fully resolve the Teams webhook integration.
-   **Robust Four Hands Live Scraping**: Develop a robust live scraping system for actual product data.
-   **Integrate Mobile App Connection**: Implement connection and syncing for the mobile app.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer made another attempt to create the main application dashboard. There has been persistent confusion between the Studio Landing Page (a beautiful interior room with overlaid text) and the Dashboard (a page listing projects and navigation buttons). The user emphatically stated that  *is* the dashboard design, not a landing page, and that  *is* the studio landing page.

In response, the AI created  (Chat Message 480, 481). This component's design uses the beautiful interior room background and ESTABLISHEDDESIGN CO. in gold text (from what the AI observed at  in Chat Message 477), attempting to integrate dashboard functionality and navigation links onto this visual base. The user's most recent feedback (Chat Message 474) indicates that the AI is *still* misinterpreting the design, stating that the logo is too small, there's no gradient/shimmer, and projects are not clickable. The AI acknowledged this, and confirmed the studio-project-hub.preview.emergentagent.com/studio link as the *actual dashboard* design (Chat Message 477, 478, 479). The AI's last action was to create  based on the visual from the customer-facing landing page, which is *still* not the project dashboard the user desires.

<optional_next_step>
Re-examine the live URL  to correctly identify the *actual dashboard design* and re-implement the main dashboard with its precise styling (gradient, shimmer, clickable projects, correct logo usage).
