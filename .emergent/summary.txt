The trajectory outlines the development of a sophisticated interior design management application. The initial broad scope, encompassing questionnaires and multiple project management sheets, was quickly focused on a key user demand: a mobile-accessible, offline-capable version of the Walkthrough and FFE (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) spreadsheets for on-site work.

A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to building a mobile application. The engineer first proposed and began scaffolding a full React Native application in a separate  directory. However, deployment and testing hurdles (Expo server connectivity, QR code access) led to a strategic pivot. To provide immediate value and a testable interface, the engineer created a mobile simulator within the existing React web application.

The current work is an intense, iterative cycle of refining this mobile simulator. The user's core requirement is that the mobile view must be an *identical* replica of the desktop version in both appearance (colors, layout, fonts) and functionality (adding rooms, checking items). The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively debugging the FFE spreadsheet component in the mobile simulator, addressing specific user feedback about incorrect header ordering, a missing Installed checkbox, and misaligned data columns.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to create an all-in-one interior design management tool. The initial vision included a client questionnaire that auto-populates project sheets, contact management, and three core spreadsheets: Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE.

The project's focus has pivoted to creating a mobile version for on-site use, which is critical for designers in the field. This mobile application must provide full access to the Walkthrough and FFE spreadsheets.

The most critical requirement, emphasized repeatedly by the user, is that the mobile experience must be an **identical clone** of the desktop version. This includes:
-   Exact replication of all columns, headers, and data fields.
-   Identical color schemes for rooms, headers, and status indicators.
-   Full functionality, including the ability to add rooms, add/edit items, and check/uncheck boxes.
-   The ability to work offline and sync data back to the server when connectivity is restored.

The mobile app is considered the bible for on-site work and its fidelity to the established desktop workflow is paramount.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) with MongoDB ( driver).
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS.
- **Mobile Strategy:** Initially started as a React Native (Expo) application. Pivoted to a web-based Mobile Simulator built within the existing React frontend to overcome deployment issues and provide a rapid prototype.
- **Data Handling:** Backend scripts were created to populate the database with test data for the Johnson project, specifically creating FFE rooms by copying them from existing checklist rooms to enable testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a monorepo with distinct frontend, backend, and (now deprecated) mobile directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core API server. It handles all data interactions with MongoDB, including fetching project details and filtering rooms by  (e.g., 'walkthrough', 'ffe').
    -   **Changes:** It was inspected to understand data loading logic. New endpoints for photo management were added, and ad-hoc logic was executed to populate the Johnson project with FFE data for testing purposes.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the main component that simulates the mobile app experience within the web browser. It manages the navigation between the project list, project menu, Walkthrough view, and FFE view.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch. It was repeatedly updated to add navigation for the FFE sheet, manage state for the selected project, and render the correct spreadsheet component. Its styling was also updated to match the application's overall aesthetic.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This component is meant to be the mobile-optimized, identical version of the desktop FFE spreadsheet. It is the central focus of the most recent development work.
    -   **Changes:** This file has undergone multiple rewrites. Initially, it was a simplified mobile version. Following user feedback, it was replaced with a direct copy of the desktop component's code. It is currently being debugged to fix header order, re-add the Installed checkbox, and correct column data alignment.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The mobile version of the Walkthrough spreadsheet.
    -   **Changes:** Similar to the FFE component, this was created to be an identical mobile clone of the desktop version, including functionality like adding rooms and color-coded headers.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Mobile FFE Spreadsheet:** Correct the UI to be an exact match of the desktop version, including header order, presence of the Installed checkbox, and proper column alignment.
- **Leica D5 Integration:** Implement the planned Bluetooth integration for capturing measurements.
- **Offline Functionality:** Implement a robust offline mode for the mobile simulator, allowing on-site edits that sync to the server when online.
- **Revisit Native Mobile App:** Decide whether to continue with the web simulator or restart development on the React Native application for a true native experience.

<current_work>
The immediate task is a critical UI bug fix on the mobile FFE spreadsheet, located in . The user provided clear visual feedback that the current implementation is not an exact replica of the desktop version.

The AI engineer was in the middle of addressing three specific issues based on user screenshots:
1.  **Header Order:** The red item header (with columns like SKU, Item Name, etc.) was incorrectly placed at the top. It needs to be moved *below* the main brown/purple room and category headers.
2.  **Missing 'Installed' Checkbox:** The Installed checkbox column, which exists on the desktop version, was mistakenly removed from the mobile view. The user has explicitly requested it back.
3.  **Column Misalignment:** The data being rendered in the table rows does not align with the correct header columns. For instance, the Item Name was appearing in the SKU column.

The AI engineer acknowledged all three points and had just started fixing the header order by editing  right as the trajectory ended.

<optional_next_step>
Continue fixing the FFE spreadsheet in  by first correcting the header order, then re-adding the 'Installed' checkbox column, and finally ensuring all data maps to the correct columns.
