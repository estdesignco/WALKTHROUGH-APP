The AI engineer primarily focused on debugging and implementing core features after an initial handoff. Key efforts included clarifying Canva App OAuth (determining it wasn't needed for the checklist app), then pivoting to user-requested fixes. Significant work was dedicated to implementing robust drag-and-drop functionality across the Checklist, Walkthrough, and FFE sheets, which involved resolving conflicting DND libraries, fixing visual rendering glitches, and ensuring persistent collapsed states via . The engineer also addressed an FFE spreadsheet header misalignment, made product links clickable, and verified existing functionality like PDF auto-import and Teams notifications. The current task involves updating Teams notification priority logic based on user feedback.

The application is an advanced interior design hub to manage projects efficiently. It features a customer questionnaire (email link, beautiful UI for room/project details), which auto-fills a designer landing page and a contact sheet. Core interactive spreadsheets (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE) need mobile/offline support, and specific features like adding/deleting rooms/items, minimizing, rearranging, taking pictures, and measurements. The Walkthrough auto-populates from the questionnaire and syncs to the Checklist. The Checklist supports item scraping from links (product name, size, color, link, image, SKU, cost), status dropdowns for a pie chart, and Teams notifications. The FFE (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) spreadsheet is the bible for designers, requiring live shipping tracking, order dates, and status dropdowns. A dream feature involves scraping all furniture sites into one place. Crucially, the UI structure, colors, and core operations are king and must not be changed without explicit instruction.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed multiple critical frontend issues. Drag-and-drop functionality for rooms and categories has been implemented and refined on ,  (Walkthrough), and  (FFE). This involved standardizing the drag-and-drop library to , fixing JSX structure issues, ensuring visual updates, and preventing full page reloads after a drag. Additionally, the expanded/collapsed state of rooms and categories now persists across page loads using . The FFE spreadsheet header alignment has been corrected, the STATUS dropdown is visible, and the LINK column now contains a clickable button to open product URLs. The auto-population of rooms from the customer questionnaire to the walkthrough has been verified as working. The backend's Microsoft Teams notification system, which triggers on item status changes in both Checklist and FFE, has also been confirmed as fully functional. The current task involves updating the priority logic for these Teams notifications based on user-specified statuses in .
