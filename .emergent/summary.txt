The trajectory chronicles the development of a complex interior design management application. The initial phase focused on building a Unified Furniture Catalog, a core feature requested by the user. This involved a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful effort to create a web scraper for . The AI engineer attempted multiple strategies, including direct scraping, debugging login flows, and implementing sophisticated anti-rate-limiting techniques. However, persistent blocking by Houzz led to a strategic pivot.

The focus then shifted to enhancing the existing Checklist workflow by automating the use of the Houzz Pro clipper extension and introducing a Canva board import feature. This work was interrupted by a critical bug report from the user: the customer-facing questionnaire was failing to submit projects, returning a generic something went wrong error.

The subsequent phase was an extensive and iterative debugging process to fix the questionnaire. The AI engineer identified and resolved a cascade of issues, including incorrect data structures (flat vs. nested objects), mismatched enum values between the frontend and backend, missing API endpoints (), and incorrect field names in the data payload ( vs. ). This required multiple code fixes, frontend rebuilds, and service restarts to resolve fully.

The most recent messages indicate that with the questionnaire finally fixed, the user has reported a new critical issue related to the core data transfer functionality between the Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE sheets, as well as a data duplication problem. The AI was just beginning to investigate this new issue when the summary was requested.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a comprehensive, technologically advanced interior design management application that streamlines the entire design process, from initial client contact to final installation.

**Key Features Implemented/Attempted:**
1.  **Customer-Facing Questionnaire:** A beautifully designed, comprehensive form for new clients. Upon submission, it must automatically create a new project, populate a Contact Sheet, and set up a Walkthrough Sheet pre-filled with the rooms and standard items relevant to the project type. This feature was recently the subject of an intensive bug-fixing effort and is now believed to be functional.
2.  **Unified Furniture Catalog:** A central, internal search engine for all furniture products clipped from various trade vendor websites. The agreed-upon data population strategy is to mirror items the designer saves to their Houzz Pro account. The UI for this feature is complete, but the data scraping mechanism from Houzz Pro remains challenging due to bot detection.
3.  **Core Workflow (Walkthrough → Checklist → FFE):** A three-stage process for managing project items. The user needs a seamless transfer function to move items from one stage to the next. This is the area of the application currently under investigation for bugs related to data transfer and duplication.
4.  **Enhanced Scraping & Integration:** The application features a link-scraping tool within its Checklist to pull product data from vendor websites. The plan is to enhance this to also auto-clip the item to Houzz Pro and to allow bulk import of product links from a Canva board.

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS for UI. State management is done via  and  hooks.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, serving a RESTful API. Pydantic models are used for data validation and serialization.
- **Database**: MongoDB, accessed asynchronously via the  library.
- **Web Scraping**: Playwright was used for browser automation in attempts to scrape . This involved handling logins, rate limiting, and complex authentication flows.
- **Deployment**: The frontend is a Create React App-based application built using  (yarn run v1.22.22

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a standard frontend/backend structure.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file containing the majority of the API endpoints, including those for creating projects (), bulk-creating items (), and Pydantic model definitions (, , etc.).
    -   **Changes**: This file was heavily modified during the questionnaire bug fix. A new  endpoint was added. The  endpoint and its corresponding Pydantic models were debugged to align with the frontend data structure.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the component for the customer-facing questionnaire form. It handles the form state, data validation, and submission logic.
    -   **Changes**: This was the primary focus of the most recent work. The  function was fixed to correctly structure the data payload for the backend (nesting ). Enum mappings for  and  were corrected. Logic was fixed to correctly map string names like  to  before sending data to the new bulk items endpoint. The room selection list was also reordered for better usability.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This component manages the Walkthrough view. It contains the logic for transferring items to the next stage (Checklist), which is the source of the current bug being investigated.
    -   **Changes**: No changes have been made yet, but this file was identified as the location of the  function that needs to be debugged to solve the item transfer and duplication issue.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the complex logic for logging into and scraping the user's Houzz Pro account. It includes functionality to handle rate limiting, realistic browser interactions, and data extraction.
    -   **Changes**: The file was created and modified multiple times to overcome Houzz's bot detection, but the effort was ultimately paused due to persistent blocking. It represents a significant but currently inactive part of the codebase.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Walkthrough Transfer:** The transfer function from the Walkthrough sheet is not working for newly created projects.
- **Investigate Project Duplication:** There are reportedly 8 duplicate copies of a project named JOHNSON in the database that need to be investigated and cleaned up, and the root cause of the duplication needs to be fixed.
- **Validate Auto-Clip & Canva Import:** The newly implemented Auto-clip to Houzz Pro toggle and the Canva Board Import features have not been tested or validated by the user.

<current_work>
The immediate focus has shifted from fixing the questionnaire to addressing a new, critical bug report from the user regarding the core application workflow. The user stated, ...the transfer on the asdflasdf works, but not on the new file i just made! also, there are 8 copies of the JOHNSON file now, and clarified this refers to the **Walkthrough → Checklist → FFE** transfer process.

The previous AI engineer had just begun investigating this issue. The work involved:
1.  **Identifying the Problem:** A data transfer failure for new projects and a data duplication issue (the JOHNSON file).
2.  **Locating the Code:** The engineer successfully located the relevant frontend code responsible for the transfer logic within the file . Specifically, the  function at line 520 was identified as the likely source of the issue.
3.  **Initial Investigation:** The engineer started analyzing the transfer function and the API calls it makes to understand how items are created and why duplicates might occur. The investigation was also beginning to look into the database to confirm the existence of the 8 JOHNSON project duplicates.

The work was paused at the very beginning of the debugging process for this new, high-priority task.

<optional_next_step>
I will start by querying the database to confirm the JOHNSON project duplication. Then, I will thoroughly analyze the  logic in  to fix the transfer and duplication bugs.
