The AI engineer's work has been an intensive, iterative process driven by user feedback, often marked by significant frustration due to broken functionality and styling discrepancies. Initially, the focus was on introducing a new email-based questionnaire workflow and overhauling the application's visual design based on a provided ZIP file and screenshots. This involved creating new components like , , and , and integrating email functionality (initially SendGrid, then Microsoft 365 SMTP, and finally attempting Gmail SMTP, which failed due to App Password requirements and was deferred).

A major challenge arose from attempts to apply a consistent gold color scheme and exact layouts across the landing page, project detail page, questionnaire, and all three spreadsheet views (Checklist, FF&E, Walkthrough). This led to numerous regressions in core spreadsheet functionality, particularly in the FF&E section, causing repeated user complaints. The engineer resorted to multiple HEAD is now at e415aa9 Auto-generated changes commands and manual file restorations to revert the FF&E, Checklist, and Walkthrough spreadsheets to previous working states, often with user guidance on specific commits or codebases.

The process has been a cycle of introducing new features/styling, breaking existing functionality, debugging, reverting, and re-applying fixes. The user's explicit instructions to NOT CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY OR STRUCTURE were frequently violated, leading to strong negative feedback. The current state is an ongoing effort to restore the FF&E spreadsheet's loading functionality after a series of reverts and debugging steps, with the latest issue being a persistent Failed to fetch error after fixing a hardcoded URL in .

The application, a React/FastAPI/MongoDB project, manages interior design FF&E data. The user's initial problem was a non-functional MVP with numerous bugs and incomplete features. The user then explicitly requested:

*   **Walkthrough Sheet**: Specific headers, plain text editable cells, red third-row header, inclusion of FF&E sheet features, and future mobile/offline capabilities.
*   **Checklist Sheet**: Specific columns, red third-row header, FFE features, 9 color-coded statuses.
*   **General/Cross-Sheet Features**: Add/restore delete buttons, robust Add Item (auto-scraping), minimize/expand for rooms/categories, muted room header colors, Canva PDF scraping for links/auto-categorization, all cells plain text editable, restore Add Category, new rooms/categories with all subcategories/items, Search/Sort, fix FFE sheet navigation, prevent page resets.
*   **New Additions**: FINISH/COLOR column in Checklist, comprehensive room/category/subcategory structure for  with specific subcategory names (only if 4+ items), enhanced scraping and thumbnail images.
*   **New Workflow**: Ability to **email a questionnaire** to a customer, which starts the Walkthrough app and adds selected rooms to the spreadsheet.
*   **UI Recreation**: Recreate the **landing page** and **questionnaire** exactly as provided in a URL and screenshots, with questionnaire answers appearing in the Walkthrough header.
*   **Styling**: Use exact gold color  throughout the app, including the actual logo on the landing page. Apply the styling from a provided ZIP file to the Landing Page, Project Detail Page, and Questionnaire. Also update background/room/header colors in all three spreadsheets (Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E), strictly without changing functionality.
*   **Conditional Questionnaire**: Implement conditional sections in the questionnaire (e.g., new build, renovations, furniture refresh reveal different questions).
*   **Project Detail Page**: Display all questionnaire answers on a dedicated project detail page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical issue with the FF&E spreadsheet. The user had reported that the FF&E was not loading the project after several reverts to restore its functionality to a previous working state (specifically commit ).

The AI engineer identified that the  component was not being routed in the restored  and fixed this, along with updating  to navigate to . However, the user still reported the project not loading for FF&E.

Upon troubleshooting with , it was identified that the backend was throwing a 503 error for the FF&E page's API calls. Further investigation revealed a  for  and a hardcoded backend URL () within  (line 53).

The AI engineer successfully updated  to use  for API calls, addressing the hardcoded URL issue. Despite this fix, the FF&E page is still displaying an Error Loading Project: Failed to load project: Failed to fetch message, indicating the project data is still not being retrieved successfully.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the FF&E page still shows Failed to fetch after fixing the hardcoded URL, by checking for other hardcoded URLs or API call issues in  and reviewing backend logs.
