The previous AI engineer successfully developed core features for the interior design application. Initial work focused on a Live Checklist Canva App with UI, bidirectional synchronization, and image uploads. A Chrome Extension for scraping product links from Canva boards was also developed but proved unreliable. The engineer then shifted focus to a PDF import feature, which initially faced MongoDB  serialization errors (503 Service Unavailable) and subsequent  issues during product scraping. These backend problems were systematically resolved, leading to successful PDF import with smart categorization and item sorting. Frontend display issues, including missing columns and small image popups, were also addressed. The current phase involves getting the Live Sheet Canva App deployed and functional within Canva, which has been successfully deployed to Canva, but requires a backend URL update, which the user has requested the AI engineer to implement.

The application's primary goal is to be an advanced interior design hub. It needs customer questionnaires, a designer landing page, contact management, and interactive spreadsheets (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE) with mobile/offline capabilities, Leica D5 laser pointer integration, and Teams notifications. A crucial aspect is **Canva integration**, involving a **Live Checklist Canva App** for in-editor display and real-time bidirectional syncing of project data, items, images, prices, and links, styled to match the main app. This Canva app should support Auto-Detection for scraping product information directly. A **Chrome Extension** was also required for scraping product links from Canva design boards, and a **PDF Import** feature was introduced as an alternative to import links from exported Canva PDFs. The application must display key item details like name, vendor, SKU, size, color, cost, and a clickable link, with intelligent categorization and new items appearing at the top.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was guiding the user through the process of deploying the Live Sheet Canva App (from ) to Canva. The user successfully created a new Apps SDK app () via the Canva CLI and built the provided app code. The app is now visible within the Canva editor, but it is not working (meaning it likely cannot connect to the backend or fetch data). The root cause is presumed to be the hardcoded  backend URL in  not being updated to the production URL. The AI engineer attempted to instruct the user to manually edit this file, but the user explicitly stated, i am NOT a code person. SO, you are gonna have to impliment code if that is what you are trying to get me to do! This indicates that the current task is for the AI engineer to programmatically make this code change.
