The project began as an ambitious interior design management tool, but quickly prioritized a mobile, offline-capable spreadsheet solution. The initial attempt to build a native React Native app was shelved due to deployment issues, leading to a pivot to a web-based Mobile Simulator. The AI engineer iteratively refined this simulator, initially focusing on replicating the desktop FFE and Walkthrough spreadsheet UIs and functionalities (headers, columns, editing). Subsequent efforts included adding offline capabilities, photo management with measurement annotations, and add item features. Recent work concentrated on fixing runtime errors, improving the click-to-edit behavior, implementing auto-sizing for cells, and enhancing Leica D5 Bluetooth integration. The trajectory concludes with the user highly satisfied with a newly designed photo management page and instructing the AI to apply this aesthetic globally, integrate a logo, and resolve persistent Leica connectivity issues.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a comprehensive interior design management application, initially encompassing a client questionnaire, contact management, and various project spreadsheets (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE). The critical requirement evolved into developing a mobile-first, offline-capable version of the Walkthrough and FFE spreadsheets for on-site use. The mobile app must be an **identical clone** of the desktop versions, preserving all columns, headers, colors, and functionality like adding/editing rooms/items, and checking boxes. Key features requested include Leica D5 laser pointer integration for measurements, advanced photo capture with arrow annotations, offline data synchronization, and a new beautiful design aesthetic to be applied consistently across the entire mobile application, including a company logo on every page. Cells need to be editable on click, without visible text boxes, and auto-fit content.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) with MongoDB (using  driver) for data storage and API endpoints.
-   **Frontend:** React.js for UI, styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent design.
-   **Mobile Strategy:** Transitioned from a React Native (Expo) attempt to a web-based Mobile Simulator within the existing React frontend.
-   **Data Handling:** Utilizes environment variables for API and database URLs; UUIDs for object IDs instead of Mongo's ObjectID.
-   **Offline Capabilities:** Implemented using Service Workers and local storage for data persistence and synchronization.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct frontend and backend directories. A  directory for React Native exists but is no longer actively developed.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Leica D5 Bluetooth Integration:** Improve stability and reliability of the connection, addressing persistent timeout issues.
-   **Global UI Aesthetic:** Apply the beautiful gold/muted gradient theme and consistent styling across *all* mobile app pages (home, projects list, project landing page, etc.).
-   **Logo Integration:** Add the user's logo at the top of every mobile app page, mirroring its placement in the desktop version.
-   **iPad Formatting:** Optimize the mobile application's layout and responsiveness for iPad devices.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant refactoring of the mobile FFE and Walkthrough spreadsheets, including implementing a click-to-edit functionality without visible text boxes, auto-fitting cell content, and integrating various features like Add Item, Delete Item, Photos, Export/Stats, Quick Add Templates, and Search/Filter. Photo management was significantly enhanced, including arrow annotations on images and a first pass at Leica D5 integration. The user provided feedback, loving the aesthetic of the newly created photo management page and explicitly requested that this beautiful gold/muted gradient theme be applied to *all* other pages in the mobile app. Additionally, the user requested their logo be placed at the top of every page, and reported that the Leica D5 connection experienced a timeout again. The AI engineer acknowledged these requests and stated the next immediate action is to find your logo as part of applying the new aesthetic globally.
