The trajectory centered on correcting and stabilizing the core client-facing and internal spreadsheet components following user complaints about inaccurate implementation (EXACT code not being used). Initial efforts involved viewing existing large component files (, , ) to confirm content. The agent then created detailed, feature-complete conceptual files (, , , ) to establish the required structure, including critical features like the scraping mechanism in Checklist and the tracking links in FFE. Despite attempts to copy the exact code to the main files (, ), the user expressed severe dissatisfaction (Chat Message 15), forcing another round of verification and explicit file overwrites. The immediate focus remains on achieving precise code replication for all main spreadsheet components before moving to complex backend integration tasks like implementing the  endpoint.

The objective is to create a technologically advanced project management tool for interior design, emphasizing a luxury aesthetic (black, gold, cream) and specific spreadsheet functionality. The workflow starts with:
1.  **Customer Intake:** Luxurious email delivery leading to a multi-section **Comprehensive Client Questionnaire** which initializes project data (Project, Rooms, Items).
2.  **Walkthrough Sheet (On-site/Offline):** Pre-loaded with questionnaire rooms/items, supporting dynamic reordering/editing, pictures, and future Bluetooth measurement integration (Leica D5).
3.  **Checklist Sheet (Curation):** Must facilitate item sourcing via **Web Scraping** (link input auto-fills item details like name, SKU, cost, image). It must support status updates linked to pie charts, Canva integration, and Teams notifications.
4.  **FFE Sheet (Logistics/Bible):** The final stage, featuring **LIVE SHIPPING TRACKING** (carrier selection, tracking number input), order date management, and installation status tracking.
5.  **Project Detail Page:** A beautiful, designer-facing page displaying all filled questionnaire data and providing tabbed access to the Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE sheets.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React.js and advanced Tailwind CSS for strict adherence to the black/gold/cream aesthetic.
-   **Backend/DB:** FastAPI (Python) using asynchronous MongoDB (motor) for CRUD operations; UUIDs are used for document IDs.
-   **Integrations:** Planned high-value features include web scraping (Checklist) and shipping carrier tracking (FFE).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a modular frontend architecture in React, accessing a FastAPI backend via environment variables.



**Key Files and Changes/Status:**
-   ****: Functions as the main dashboard, fetching project data () and providing tabbed navigation to Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE sheets. A detailed implementation showing extensive project data display (client info, scope, design questions) was created in  and is intended to be the final version.
-   ** (Conceptual/Intermediate)**: Contains the full implementation logic for the curation sheet, including checkboxes, display of item images/SKUs, a robust filtering system, and the crucial  function which calls . This functionality has been copied to .
-   ** (Conceptual/Intermediate)**: Contains the full implementation logic for the logistics sheet, including , dynamic tracking URL generation ( for UPS, FedEx, etc.), and columns for Carrier and Tracking Number. This is intended to be the source for .
-   ****: Recently overwritten to include the scraping UI and functionality.
-   ****: Recently overwritten with the expected Walkthrough spreadsheet structure (Item, Vendor, SKU, Cost, QTY, Status, Notes columns).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Finalize the overwrite of  with the exact code (including tracking UI/logic).
-   Implement the crucial backend endpoint  in  to support the Checklist's core functionality.
-   Implement the backend logic to save tracking numbers and carrier information in the MongoDB  model, required by the FFE sheet.

<current_work>
The most recent activity was an urgent response to the user's demand (Chat Message 15) to use the *exact* required component code, indicating previous attempts at stabilization were flawed. The AI engineer defined the final required state by creating detailed conceptual files: , , and .

The immediate preceding actions were:
1.  Writing the detailed client/project overview to  (which serves as the template for ).
2.  Overwriting  with the intended Walkthrough code (basic item tracking, quantity, notes).
3.  Overwriting  with the intended Curation Checklist code. This code includes the UI components for image display, SKU/Cost fields, and the  button that triggers  (calling the missing  endpoint).
4. The trajectory concluded just before attempting to overwrite  with the correct logistics-focused code (tracking number input, carrier dropdown, and a  button that opens external carrier websites).
The current focus is structure and component integrity, prioritizing user satisfaction on the aesthetic/layout front over new feature implementation.
