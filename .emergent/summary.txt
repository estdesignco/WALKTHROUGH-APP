The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Interior Design Project Management App from a non-functional state to a more stable one. Key achievements included resolving persistent Kubernetes ingress routing issues, rectifying a critical MongoDB connection problem that was causing 500 errors on the  endpoint, and fixing the default FINISH/COLOR column to be blank. A major breakthrough was the successful implementation of the Walkthrough â†’ Checklist Transfer to only move *checked* items, which was a long-standing user frustration, achieved by aligning backend logic with a provided Google Apps Script. However, some frontend rendering issues, such as incorrect subcategory headers in the Walkthrough, and the robust implementation of web scraping, remained incomplete or problematic. The most recent efforts focused on improving category creation and robust web scraping.

<product_requirements>
The application is an Interior Design Project Management App. Its core functionality is a spreadsheet-based system across Questionnaire, Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE modules, integrated with external services like Houzz Pro, MS Teams, My Measures, and Canva for sequential data flow and project management.
Key modules and their requirements include:
1.  **Questionnaire**: Customer-facing, for project and personal details.
2.  **Designer Landing Page**: Populated from the questionnaire.
3.  **Contact Sheet**: Manages project contacts.
4.  **Walkthrough**: Mobile-first, offline capable; allows pre-loaded rooms/items, adding/deleting/rearranging elements, media capture (Leica D5 integration), and transferring *selected* items to Checklist.
5.  **Checklist (Curation)**: Similar features; Add Item via web scraping (product details, image, cost); status dropdowns for presentation charts and Teams integration; Canva board automation; transfers to FFE.
6.  **FFE (Bible for Designers)**: Offline, onsite use; live shipping tracking; status dropdowns for FOR INSTALL charts; order date cells.
7.  **Ultimate Dream**: Unified furniture search engine for scraping vendor data and direct Checklist integration.
**Implementation done so far**: Core backend APIs, React frontend components, initial data transfer logic (Walkthrough to Checklist, Checklist to FFE), and basic web scraping. Recent work focused on critical bug fixes to make the application functional and reliable for project data management and transfer workflows.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (persistence), Playwright (web scraping).
-   **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Craco.
-   **Integrations**: SMTP (Gmail), Microsoft Teams API (webhooks), Canva API, Web Scraping.
-   **Architecture**: Monorepo, RESTful APIs, PWA (offline capability), Kubernetes Ingress, Supervisor.
-   **Google Apps Script**: Used as a reference for transfer logic.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI, Python) and  (React.js, JavaScript) directories.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for backend, notably .
    -   **Changes**: Verified MongoDB URL and corrected Backend URL configuration during initial setup.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central API hub, orchestrates backend services, defines Pydantic models.
    -   **Changes**: 's  default was set to blank. The  endpoint was modified to *not* auto-populate rooms with full comprehensive structure when  is  and fixed its database insertion logic.  endpoint was fixed and  was imported. The  function is currently being enhanced for robustness.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines comprehensive room/category structures and template data.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for  and comprehensive structure details; no direct modifications in this trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores frontend environment variables, particularly .
    -   **Changes**: Verified  consistency.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: React app entry point.
    -   **Changes**:  was temporarily disabled for debugging input issues, then re-enabled.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders the walkthrough spreadsheet and handles item transfer logic.
    -   **Changes**: The  logic was repeatedly refined to transfer *only checked items*. The rendering logic was modified to display proper subcategory names (e.g., PENDANT LIGHTS) instead of generic headers (UNIT). Its category dropdown and  function were updated to use the new comprehensive backend categories.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders the checklist spreadsheet.
    -   **Changes**: Its category dropdown and  function were updated to use the new comprehensive backend categories.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders the FFE spreadsheet.
    -   **Changes**: Its category dropdown and  function were updated to use the new comprehensive backend categories.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the New Client form.
    -   **Changes**: Input field issues (single-character entry) were addressed by replacing controlled components with uncontrolled HTML inputs and  extraction, and resolving an orphaned Node.js process issue.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Walkthrough Subcategory Display**: The walkthrough spreadsheet still displays generic headers (INSTALLED, UNIT) instead of actual subcategory names.
-   **SCRAPING**: The web scraping functionality in Add Item is not working robustly and needs significant improvement.
-   **Mobile App & Leica D5 Integration**: Initial requirements not yet started.
-   **Comprehensive Web Scraping Legal Compliance**: Needs verification.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues. The  functionality across all sheets (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE) was fixed to properly populate categories with all subcategories and items from the comprehensive structure, and its backend endpoint was corrected. The sheet independence, ensuring that rooms/categories added or deleted on one sheet only affect that sheet, was verified to be correctly implemented in the backend's  endpoint.

The primary focus at the very end of the trajectory was on enhancing the **scraping functionality**. The user reported that scraping was STILL NOT WORKING and emphasized the need for it to be EXTREMELY robust and capable of extracting detailed information like SKU, product name, price, image, and size for both Checklist and FFE modules. The AI engineer located the  function in  and began implementing significant enhancements to its logic to achieve this robustness, which involves a comprehensive approach to extracting product data from various web page structures. This work is actively in progress.
