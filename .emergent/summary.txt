The previous AI engineer diligently built several core features for the interior design application across multiple phases, directly addressing user requests. Key accomplishments include developing a functional Live Checklist Canva App with UI consistency and basic project/room navigation, implementing bidirectional synchronization, and adding image upload capabilities to Canva. A significant effort was also made to develop a Chrome Extension for scraping product links from Canva boards. However, the Chrome Extension consistently struggled with accurately identifying product links due to Canva's DOM structure and misidentification of trade vs. retail sites. The most recent focus has shifted to implementing a PDF import feature as an alternative to the struggling Chrome Extension, which itself hit a snag with MongoDB  serialization errors on the backend. The engineer is currently fixing this critical backend issue to ensure a stable product before further development.

The overarching goal is an advanced interior design application. Core features include customer questionnaires, a designer landing page, a contact sheet, and interactive spreadsheets for Walkthrough, Checklist (Curation), and FFE. Mobile app integration, offline capabilities, Leica D5 laser pointer integration, photo capture with annotations, and Microsoft Teams notifications are essential.

Crucially, **Canva integration** is a primary requirement, encompassing:
1.  **Live Checklist Canva App:** This in-editor app must display project checklist data (items, images, prices, links, status) organized by rooms and categories. It needs collapsing/expanding rooms, item check/uncheck (auto-setting Picked status), clickable product URLs, and image display. The app requires Auto-Detection to intelligently scrape product information from links/images within Canva designs, categorize it, and add it to the main checklist. Real-time bidirectional syncing and UI matching the main app's dark styling (black/blue gradient, gold/cream text) are critical. It must support room navigation, persist project/room IDs across views, and have a refresh mechanism.
2.  **Chrome Extension:** Designed to scan Canva design boards for trade-specific product links and automatically import them into the main checklist with smart categorization, streamlining the sourcing process.
3.  **PDF Import:** An alternative method to import product links from Canva boards by exporting the board as a PDF and uploading it to the application for scraping.

    -   : For batch image uploads to Canva.
    -   : For AI-powered product categorization.
    -   : For generating Excel reports (currently problematic).
    -   : For PDF link extraction and import.
    -   **Changes**: Added new endpoints, updated existing ones to support  timestamps, and repeatedly fixed  serialization issues.
-   ****: Renders the main checklist.
    -   **Changes**: Added GET CANVA SCANNER button, Upload to Canva button, and Import from PDF button.
-   ****: The core source for the Canva Live Checklist app.

-   **Stabilize PDF Import Feature:** Resolve the persistent  occurring during PDF processing to ensure product links are extracted and imported correctly.
-   **Enhance Chrome Extension Scraping:** Although debug logging was added, the extension still fails to find trade vendor product links embedded in Canva designs. A more robust scraping mechanism specifically for Canva's internal data structures is needed.
-   **Implement Canva App Auto-Detection:** The Auto-Detection feature to intelligently scrape product information directly from within the Canva App via its SDK is not yet fully functional.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting a critical backend error related to the newly implemented PDF import functionality. The user had uploaded a PDF, but the backend responded with  and logs showed a . This issue, specifically concerning MongoDB's  not being JSON serializable, has been a recurring problem for the AI engineer.

The AI engineer's last action was to modify  to fix this MongoDB ObjectId serialization error and then restart the backend server. The user's last question, is it fixed?, indicates that the current state is one of awaiting confirmation on this specific fix, and the system is in a state of flux with the backend having just been restarted. The PDF import feature, which was introduced as an alternative to the problematic Chrome Extension, is currently non-functional due to this error. The Chrome Extension itself, even with debugging, is still unable to correctly identify embedded product links on Canva boards.
