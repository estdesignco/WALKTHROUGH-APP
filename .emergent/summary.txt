The trajectory details an iterative development process focusing on expanding an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application with new customer-facing features and fixing persistent bugs. Key challenges involved replicating UI designs *exactly* from provided assets, maintaining core existing spreadsheet functionalities, and resolving numerous loading and data-mapping issues. The AI engineer struggled with user instructions, leading to several misinterpretations, particularly regarding navigation elements and the structure of spreadsheet components, which caused significant user frustration and multiple rollbacks. Critical fixes included resolving a hardcoded URL issue, addressing React StrictMode problems, and correcting data mapping for project details. The AI also implemented a comprehensive customer questionnaire and integrated existing spreadsheet components (Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E) into a new project detail page, carefully hiding their internal navigation. The conversation concluded with the AI working to ensure consistency of UI elements (like Add Category and Transfer buttons) across all spreadsheet pages.

The primary objective is to enhance an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for interior design FF&E data management. Critical requirements include:

*   **Existing Spreadsheet Preservation:** The Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E sheets (colors, format, form, function) are paramount and **must remain untouched** in their original studio view.
*   **New Customer-Facing Interface:** Develop a client-facing workflow with:
    *   A **Landing Page** ( or root ) for project overview (New Client, Email New Client, Full Questionnaire buttons, project cards with actions).
    *   A **Comprehensive Client Questionnaire** () with detailed sections (Client Info, Scope of Work, Project Type with conditional questions, Design Questions, etc.), file uploads, and room selection.
    *   A **Project Detail Page** ( or ) displaying client/project info, featuring tabs for Questionnaire (showing *filled answers* and editable), Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E.
*   **Exact UI Replication:** Recreate the new landing page, project detail page, and questionnaire **precisely** from user-provided ZIP files and screenshots, including logos, specific gold color (), and a dark theme.
*   **Enhanced Scraping:** Improve product scraping to be extremely thorough and fix Canva PDF scraping to extract *all* links. (Note: These scraping tasks were mentioned but not actively worked on in detail in this trajectory).
*   **Mobile-Ready Walkthrough:** The Walkthrough sheet needs to function as a mobile app portion, working offline and then syncing back to the desktop app. It will transfer data to the Checklist.
*   **UI Consistency:** Features like Add Category and Transfer buttons should be consistently applied across Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E sheets once implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing user-requested UI consistency across the Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E spreadsheet components, specifically after the user expressed frustration about the Walkthrough not matching the other sheets and reiterating that functionality should be consistent.

The AI engineer addressed:
1.  **Walkthrough Specific Changes**:
    *   Moved the PROJECT ROOMS section to the top of the .
    *   Modified  to change ITEM to SUB CATEGORY with a dropdown.
    *   Made checkboxes smaller, changed Add Room button to gold, and toned down Filter and Clear buttons.
    *   Added Add Category and delete buttons for rooms, categories, and rows.
    *   Added minimize functionality to room and category headers.
    *   Added a TRANSFER button to the top section of the Walkthrough.
2.  **UI Consistency (Add Category Button)**: The user explicitly requested that anything made to work on one sheet (like the Add Category button at the bottom of Walkthrough) must work on all sheets.
    *   The Add Category button has been added to the  component, next to the Add Item button.
