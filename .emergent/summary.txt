The trajectory chronicles the development of a complex interior design management application, moving from a buggy state to a feature-rich platform. The initial work involved intensive debugging of the frontend, starting with a critical rendering failure in the FF&E tab. This was traced to a race condition in  and was successfully resolved.

A significant portion of the interaction was dedicated to aligning the application with the user's very specific, pre-existing code and UI standards. This led to a period of instability as the AI engineer navigated multiple versions of components (e.g.,  vs. ), breaking and then restoring functionality by identifying the correct, most complete files. A key architectural fix was implementing  filtering in the API calls for each dashboard, ensuring the Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE sheets loaded their data independently.

The focus then shifted to the high-value web scraping feature. This involved a recurring issue of installing Playwright browser dependencies after backend restarts. The scraping logic in  was progressively enhanced, moving from capturing incorrect data (logos instead of product images, wrong data types) to a powerful multi-strategy approach that reliably extracts all product details, including the correct image from  meta tags.

The final phase pivots to the user's dream feature: a unified furniture search engine populated by intercepting data from the existing Houzz Pro clipper, effectively building a private, searchable vendor catalog. The foundational components for this feature were discovered to already exist, and the current task is to integrate the data interception mechanism.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build a high-end, bespoke project management application for an interior design firm, featuring a sophisticated black, gold, and cream user interface. The core workflow is designed to streamline the entire design process:

1.  **Client Questionnaire**: A beautiful, customer-facing form that automatically populates the initial project details.
2.  **Three Interconnected Sheets**:
    *   **Walkthrough**: For on-site notes, with future plans for offline capabilities.
    *   **Checklist**: The curation phase where designers add potential items. This requires a powerful **Web Scraping** tool to pull product data (name, SKU, cost, size, image) directly from vendor websites via a URL.
    *   **FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment)**: The logistics and tracking phase, requiring fields for order status, shipping carrier, and tracking numbers.

3.  **Unified Furniture Search (The Dream Feature)**: The ultimate goal is to create a central, searchable furniture database. This database is to be populated by intercepting data from the existing **Houzz Pro clipper**. When a designer clips a product to Houzz, the data must also be dropped off at our application and saved to the central catalog. From this search interface, users can then add items directly to a project's Checklist and a corresponding Canva board.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js with advanced Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with an asynchronous  driver for MongoDB.
- **Web Scraping**: Implemented on the backend using **Playwright** for robustly handling JavaScript-heavy vendor websites.
- **Architecture**: A standard single-page application (SPA) with a RESTful API backend. Follows strict Kubernetes ingress rules requiring all API routes to be prefixed with .
- **Integration Strategy**: The plan is to intercept data from the third-party Houzz Pro clipper via a **webhook endpoint** to populate an internal database.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a standard monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, containing all API endpoints for projects, rooms, items, and the highly complex web scraping logic.
    -   **Changes**: The  function was significantly refactored to implement a multi-strategy image extraction approach (prioritizing  tags) and to correct data types (e.g., ensuring  is a float). Duplicate, conflicting  endpoints were removed.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: These are container components that manage data fetching for each respective spreadsheet.
    -   **Changes**: All three dashboard files were modified to include the  query parameter in their API fetch calls. This was a critical fix to ensure data independence between the sheets. Imports were also updated to point to the correct, fully-featured spreadsheet components.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Renders the FF&E spreadsheet. It was the subject of significant UI/UX improvements.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Fixed a page jump issue by replacing  with a prop-based  callback.
        -   Added an image expansion modal by adding state and an  handler to product images.
        -   Integrated the full scraping functionality, adding a LINK input field and a SCRAPE button identical to the one in the Checklist component.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the UI for the dream feature, providing a search interface for the central furniture catalog.
    -   **Changes**: This pre-existing file was identified as the correct component to use for the furniture search feature, and the application's routing in  was updated to render it.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: A new backend module created to house the logic for the central furniture catalog, including search functionality and the future webhook endpoint.
    -   **Changes**: This file was created to separate the furniture search logic from the main  file.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the backend webhook endpoint to receive product data posted from the Houzz Pro clipper.
- Implement the logic to process and save the intercepted Houzz data into the central furniture database.
- Implement the Add to Checklist and Add to Canva functions within the  component, allowing users to move products from the central catalog into specific projects.

<current_work>
The immediate past work involved a significant effort to stabilize the three core spreadsheets (Walkthrough, Checklist, FF&E) and perfect the web scraping feature. All spreadsheets are now visually correct, functionally independent due to  API filtering, and use the correct, full-featured versions of their respective components.

The web scraping functionality, driven by the  endpoint in , is now highly robust. After extensive debugging, it correctly extracts all key product details (name, SKU, price, dimensions, color) and, most importantly, reliably identifies and captures the main product image by prioritizing  meta tags. This functionality has been successfully integrated into the FF&E spreadsheet, which now also features UI bug fixes (no page jump on add item) and UX improvements (image expansion modal).

The current focus has just pivoted to the Unified Furniture Search. An existing, well-designed frontend component () and a new backend module () have been identified and integrated into the application's routing. The immediate task is to build the data ingestion pipeline for this feature by intercepting data from the existing Houzz Pro clipper.
