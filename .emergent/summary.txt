The trajectory details an iterative debugging process centered on the Ultimate Furniture Search App. Initially, the AI engineer received a broad product vision for an interior design application but quickly narrowed the focus to resolving critical frontend display issues. The user's primary demand was for existing features to work and work WELL, specifically regarding product images and pricing.

The AI engineer systematically investigated the problem: first reviewing frontend components (), then inspecting the MongoDB database for  content (identifying placeholder image URLs), and finally meticulously testing backend API endpoints (, , ) via . Crucially, backend API tests revealed that products *were* being returned with valid base64 image data and correct  values, contradicting the initial database inspection. This led the AI engineer to suspect browser caching or a specific frontend rendering nuance, advising the user to hard refresh or use a different browser.

The core product vision is a sophisticated interior design management application, initially encompassing a customer questionnaire, designer landing page, contact sheet, mobile-interfaced walkthrough sheets (offline capable, with rich editing, measurement, and photo features), and a Checklist/Curation phase with web scraping, status tracking, and Canva integration. The dream feature is a unified search for all furniture vendors.

The immediate focus has shifted to building a robust Ultimate Furniture Search App. This involves:
1.  **Consolidated Vendor Catalog Search:** A single UI to search product information (SKU, price, name from spreadsheets) and images (scraped from retail sites).
2.  **Advanced Product Display:** Ensuring large, zoomable images with color variation selection.
3.  **Real Houzz Pro Integration (Paused):** Automated clipping of items to Houzz Pro.
4.  **Hybrid Scraping:** Using vendor spreadsheets for data and retail sites for images, incorporating IP protection.
5.  **Comprehensive Catalog Processing:** Ingesting thousands of products from vendor spreadsheets.

Currently, the primary explicit request is to ensure the **existing furniture search functionality works flawlessly**, specifically fixing persistent issues with image display and accurate pricing in the frontend.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI),  (for MongoDB async operations), Playwright (web scraping),  (spreadsheet parsing).
-   **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Database:** MongoDB (using  and  databases,  collection).
-   **Data Format:** Images are required to be saved and served in Base64 format.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct backend and frontend services.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Main backend entry point; orchestrates API routes, database connections, and business logic. It handles the  prefixed routes.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** While not explicitly changed in this trajectory segment, it's the core orchestrator of the functionality debugged.
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains environment variables like ,  (), and credentials for external services (Houzz Pro, Gmail).
    -   **Summary of Changes:** No direct changes observed; critical for correct database and service configuration.
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages direct interactions with the  collection within the  database.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Not directly inspected or changed in this trajectory, but implicitly involved in database operations.
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the FastAPI routes and logic for the furniture catalog, including , , and . This file is crucial for fetching and searching products displayed in the frontend.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Its endpoints were extensively tested, confirming they return products with valid base64 image data and  fields.
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Stores , essential for frontend API calls to the backend.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** None observed.
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main React application file, responsible for setting up the overall structure and rendering major components.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Integrates the  component.
-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core frontend component for the furniture search UI, handling product display, filtering, and image rendering.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This component's product display and image rendering sections were inspected, as it is the direct interface for the image/price issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix Image Display:** Ensure product images are consistently displayed.
-   **Implement Advanced Image Gallery:** Fully enable multiple images, zoom, and lightbox.
-   **Implement Color Variation Selection:** Add UI/backend for color options.
-   **Implement Full IP Protection:** Integrate VPNs/proxies for scraping.
-   **Scale Catalog Processing:** Ingest all remaining vendor spreadsheets.
-   **Finalize Real Houzz Pro Integration:** Address login and saving issues.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately focused on debugging the persistent issue of product images not displaying and Price on request appearing in the frontend, despite previous attempts to fix them.

The steps taken were:
1.  **Frontend Inspection:** Reviewed  to understand how images and prices are rendered.
2.  **Database Inspection:** Used  to check product data in the  collection within the  database. Initially, placeholder image URLs (unsplash, placeholder) were observed.
3.  **Backend API Testing:** Used  to directly query the backend endpoints (, , ). These tests revealed that the backend *was* correctly serving products with  containing valid base64 data and  fields.
4.  **Screenshot and Diagnosis:** Took a screenshot (though not visible in output) and, based on the disparity between database inspection (initial observation of placeholder URLs) and live API responses (actual base64 data), concluded the issue might be related to browser caching or a specific frontend rendering nuance on the user's end.

The current state is that the AI engineer has verified the backend is supplying correct data (base64 images, valid costs) and believes the frontend is correctly built to consume it. The problem is now attributed to potential client-side issues like browser caching, leading to the recommendation for the user to perform a hard refresh or try a different browser.
