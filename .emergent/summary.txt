The previous AI engineer worked on an interior design application, transitioning from a Google Sheets workflow to a React/FastAPI platform. Their primary focus was on replicating the UI/UX, fixing bugs, and implementing core features like web scraping, room templates, categories, and a paint catalog. The trajectory details an iterative and often challenging process, particularly in accurately replicating the complex FF&E spreadsheet design. The AI engineer frequently grappled with precise visual elements, leading to multiple rounds of feedback and corrections regarding header structures, color palettes, and functional dropdowns. Significant effort was also dedicated to ensuring web scraping functionality worked correctly and that newly added rooms automatically populated with comprehensive categories and items. The conversation reflects a back-and-forth, with the AI attempting to integrate user feedback while sometimes introducing regressions, necessitating repeated refinements of the frontend components and backend data structures.

The application aims to digitize an interior designer's workflow, primarily replacing Google Sheets for client processes like FF&E management. Key requirements include:
*   **FF&E Spreadsheet UI**: Exact replication of a complex spreadsheet with a 3-level hierarchy (Room > Category > Sub-category) for row headers. It needs specific muted yet distinct colors for rooms (e.g., purple for Living Room), categories (e.g., dark green for Lighting), and column group headers (ADDITIONAL INFO. in brown, SHIPPING INFO. in purple). Main column headers (e.g., INSTALLED, VENDOR/SKU) should be red with good contrast, without white border rectangles around text fields.
*   **Functionality**: Mac-friendly horizontal scrolling; free-flow editable cells; functional, color-coded dropdowns for 22 status options, 21 carrier options, 4 ship-to options, and 14 delivery status options, all defaulting to blank and displaying colored dots. Functional date pickers and smart tracking links.
*   **Data Management**: Automatic population of all categories and items when a new room is added. Category consolidation logic for small categories.
*   **Reporting**: A double-sized pie chart status overview with item counts (Completed, In Transit, etc.) and a separate shipping carrier breakdown with its own pie chart and colored lists.
*   **Integrations**: Robust web scraping (Playwright) for product info from 24 wholesale vendors (including JavaScript-rendered sites). Google Calendar sync for dates, real-time tracking updates, photo uploads.
*   **Future Expansion**: Apply structural improvements to Checklist and Walkthrough sheets. Implement drag-and-drop, minimize/expand features.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application. Handles API endpoints for items, rooms, categories, scraping, and tracking.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  selectors. Enhanced Pydantic models for item tracking and dates. Integrated  for comprehensive room creation. Contains definitions for statuses, carriers, and their associated colors.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: A new file housing the extensive, detailed .
    -   **Changes**: Created to hold the full hierarchical structure of rooms, categories, subcategories, and numerous default items, ensuring automatic population upon room creation.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Manages the overall FF&E view, including data loading and rendering the spreadsheet component.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored  for data loading, integrated , and passed necessary data (like ) to subcomponents.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Displays summary information: pie charts, item totals, and breakdowns for status and carriers.
    -   **Changes**: Restored the pie chart and detailed item totals (Completed, In Transit, etc.). Modified to display colored status bars and colored carrier breakdown sections with colored dots. Layout adjusted to place the pie chart above totals.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: The central component for displaying and interacting with the FF&E spreadsheet. Underwent numerous modifications to align with precise UI/UX requirements.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Header Structure**: Removed a separate INSTALLED header. INSTALLED now replaces ITEM NAME as the first column header. ADDITIONAL INFO. and SHIPPING INFO. are top-level section headers. All other column headers are positioned below.
        -   **Colors**: Implemented a muted, professional color palette (purple for Living Room, dark green for Lighting, red for column headers, brown for ADDITIONAL INFO., purple for SHIPPING INFO.).
        -   **Input Fields**: Removed white border rectangles from text-based input fields (e.g., ITEM NAME, VENDOR/SKU, FINISH/Color, Tracking #, Notes). Only date pickers and dropdowns retain visible containers.
        -   **Dropdowns**: Added color-coded dropdowns for Status, Carrier, Ship To, and Delivery Status. Dropdowns now default to blank options (e.g., Select Status...) and display a colored dot next to the selected item.  handlers added for proper state management and color display.
        -   **Live Tracking**: Integrated Track Live buttons linked to the backend  endpoint.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical user demands related to the FF&E spreadsheet's core functionality and visual presentation. The primary focus was on ensuring that the Add Room feature automatically populates a newly created room with its entire comprehensive structure, including all associated categories and items (demonstrated by a Living Room adding 389 items). Concurrently, the AI was tasked with ensuring that all dropdown menus within the spreadsheet defaulted to a blank state (e.g., Select Status..., Select Carrier...) and that selected options displayed their corresponding colored dots.

Furthermore, the Status Overview and Carrier Breakdown sections were refined: the previously removed pie chart was restored, positioned above the item totals (Completed, In Transit, etc.). The carrier breakdown list, along with its colored dots, was also moved to its correct location. The AI confirmed these changes, reporting that rooms are created with the full structure, dropdowns have blank defaults, and colored dots are visible. The final state is an FF&E spreadsheet with a correct hierarchical layout, muted colors, working dropdowns with color-coded options and blank defaults, and restored summary charts.
