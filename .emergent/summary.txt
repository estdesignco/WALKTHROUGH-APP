<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory involved an iterative development process for an FF&E management application, characterized by feature implementation, critical regressions, and extensive user feedback. Initially, the AI addressed UI, backend scraping, and comprehensive room population, but a significant regression occurred when the  was inadvertently replaced, leading to a visual and structural mismatch. User feedback repeatedly highlighted deviations from the desired design, particularly regarding colors, button placement, and the core spreadsheet structure. The AI engineer made multiple attempts to revert changes and re-implement features, facing challenges with screenshot interpretation and ensuring the 's original layout was preserved. Backend functionality for CRUD operations and scraping was robustly developed, but frontend integration and visual fidelity proved difficult, leading to a cycle of fixes and user-reported regressions. The AI's final action was to revert to the original spreadsheet structure while selectively applying visual and functional enhancements.

<product_requirements>
The application aims to replace Google Sheets for interior designers' FF&E management. Key requirements include a 3-level hierarchical spreadsheet (Room > Category > Sub-category) with specific UI: muted colors (e.g., purple rooms, dark green categories, brown ADDITIONAL INFO., purple SHIPPING INFO., red main headers) and text fields without white borders. Functionality demands Mac-friendly horizontal scrolling, free-flow editable cells, color-coded dropdowns (status, carriers, ship-to, delivery status) with blank defaults and colored dots, functional date pickers, smart tracking links, and auto-population of hundreds of categories/items upon new room addition. Reporting requires true pie charts for status/carrier breakdowns. Integrations involve robust web scraping (Playwright) for 24 wholesale vendors (product info: name, vendor, SKU, image, cost, size), Google Calendar sync, real-time tracking, and photo uploads. The user explicitly requests delete/minimize buttons, working scraping, and an additional pie chart, all within the *original  design*, with a dark/black background, specific button placements (left side, brown/tan/gold colors), and expand/collapse arrows. Drag and drop for rooms and categories is also critical.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend, exposing API endpoints for managing FF&E data (items, rooms, categories), web scraping, and project tracking.
    -   **Changes**: Added missing DELETE endpoints for rooms and items, POST endpoint for category creation, and PUT/UPDATE endpoints for rooms and categories to support reordering. Includes Pydantic models for data validation.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Defines  which is a detailed hierarchical structure for automatically populating rooms with categories, subcategories, and default items upon creation.
    -   **Changes**: Used to ensure new rooms are populated with extensive default content, improving data consistency.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Main React component, sets up routing () and manages the top-level application state, including the .
    -   **Changes**: Modified to correctly handle project loading when navigating directly to FF&E routes by introducing a  hook to load project data and a  component to manage this logic, resolving a critical routing/state management issue.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Orchestrates the FF&E view, loads project data, and renders  and .
    -   **Changes**: Debugged project loading and passed  prop to  to enable new room functionality.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Displays summary data using pie charts (status, carrier, location breakdowns) and total item counts.
    -   **Changes**: Uses  for real-time charting; layout and color adjustments were made in previous iterations.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: The primary component for displaying and interacting with the FF&E data in a hierarchical spreadsheet format, as preferred by the user. This file has been the main focus of changes and reversions.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent multiple significant changes and subsequent reverts. It was initially modified to add  function, state for category management,  for loading categories, and enhanced Add Category dropdown. Drag & drop functionality () was integrated. After user complaints about altered structure and colors, the file was completely rewritten multiple times to restore the original layout, and then selectively modified to add specific features (dark background, full-width headers, search filters, specific button colors/placement, minimize arrows) while aiming to preserve the exact original table structure.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: A modal component for adding new items, including manual input and web scraping.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed  function to ensure it calls the correct backend endpoint for web scraping and correctly populates form fields.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure Add Room functionality fully works, visually populating the full comprehensive structure as expected on the frontend.
-   Improve scraping to consistently extract image, cost, and size, directing data to correct fields.
-   Apply comprehensive room structure to  and  sheets (these sheets have not been addressed).
-   Refine drag-and-drop functionality for smooth operation without UI/structure issues.
-   Implement minimize/expand arrows (▼ ▶) next to room and category names for collapsing/expanding sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on restoring the  component to its *original table structure* following repeated user complaints that previous modifications had corrupted the spreadsheet's layout and colors. The AI engineer explicitly stated, Let me immediately revert back to the ORIGINAL ExactFFESpreadsheet structure and ONLY make the specific changes you requested - keeping the table structure EXACTLY as it was.

The last action performed was writing  to achieve this reversion. The AI claims to have restored the original table structure while selectively applying visual and functional enhancements: changing the background to dark navy (), making room headers full width with expand/collapse functionality, adding a search section with five dropdowns and filter buttons, updating button colors to a gold/amber theme, moving buttons to the left side (), and adding minimize/expand arrows. The current state is that the AI believes the  now has the original table structure combined with the requested visual and interactive features, and it is about to test this updated version.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the current build of  to verify that the original table structure is preserved and all recently added visual and functional features (dark background, button placement, drag-and-drop, expand/collapse) are working as expected without regressions.
