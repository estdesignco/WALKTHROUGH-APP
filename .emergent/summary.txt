<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive interior design workflow application, evolving it from a luxurious UI prototype into a functional unified search engine with integrations. Initial tasks involved fixing backend dependencies and import paths. A major focus was on UI/UX, implementing a luxury black/gold/cream theme across dashboards while preserving existing color schemes. The core achievement in this trajectory was the development of a Unified Furniture Search Engine, which included secure vendor credential management, sample product scraping, and advanced multi-filter search capabilities. Challenges included debugging frontend rendering issues and ensuring API calls were correctly integrated. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, implemented Canva and Houzz Pro integrations, and expanded search filters to include size, color, and material. The process culminated in fixing frontend loading states and ensuring the search engine, with its various integrations and filters, was fully operational and tested.

<product_requirements>
The user, an interior designer, required a sophisticated application to streamline project management and product sourcing. The primary goal was a luxury black/gold/cream themed application. Initial requirements included an elegant email questionnaire system, prominent logo integration, themed studio/spreadsheet dashboards while preserving functional color coding, and add-room functionality.

During this trajectory, the user explicitly requested and the AI engineer implemented:
1.  **Unified Search Engine**: A central platform to search products from multiple vendors, eliminating the need for 1,000,000 tabs. This required secure credential storage for vendors (Four Hands, Hudson Valley Lighting), a hybrid scraping system, and advanced multi-filter search (vendor, category, room type, price range, color, material, size, style, etc.).
2.  **Canva Integration**: A one-click system to add scraped product images with links to specific Canva project boards/sheets.
3.  **Houzz Pro Integration**: Automation to leverage Houzz's web clipper functionality, allowing one-click addition of products to Houzz Pro selection boards with auto-filled details.
4.  **Enhanced Search Filters**: Expansion of the search engine to include filters for size, color, material, style, shape, seat count, light types, and availability.
5.  **Go Button for Filters**: A dedicated GO button to apply selected filters, distinct from the main search bar.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to the end of the trajectory, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the search interface based on explicit user requests. The user requested to add end tables, dining tables, and console tables to the quick search buttons, and a separate GO button for applying filters.

The engineer made modifications to the  component to introduce new quick search buttons (, , , , ,  were previously added, and now , ,  are being added). A dedicated  button was also being implemented for applying the more comprehensive set of filters (Colors, Materials, Sizes, Styles, Shapes, Seat Counts, Light Types, Availability), distinct from the main search bar.

The last action recorded was modifying  to add the missing  function, which is crucial for the functionality of the new GO button and the quick search filters. The frontend was then restarted to apply and test these changes. The core search engine, vendor management, and basic Canva/Houzz integration buttons were already confirmed working, but this specific task focused on refining the search experience with additional filters and a dedicated apply button.
