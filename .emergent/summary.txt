<analysis>
The previous trajectory focused on achieving EXACT code replication for critical frontend components, addressing user dissatisfaction regarding aesthetics and functionality, which led to high churn in key files. The initial effort to replace the customer-facing components resulted in the incorrect replacement of the essential Comprehensive Questionnaire with a simpler version. This was corrected by locating and implementing the true comprehensive questionnaire () and restoring the luxury landing page ().

The subsequent phase targeted the core spreadsheet components (Walkthrough, Checklist, FFE). This phase also saw a failure, as the Checklist was mistakenly replaced with FFE logic, forcing the AI to revert the file. The final action was conceptual: the AI defined the structure and key features of the corrected Walkthrough, Checklist (with scraping/Canva logic), and FFE (with live tracking logic) in temporary files, essentially confirming the architectural plan before proceeding with the complex integration and feature implementation. The system is currently stable regarding the core customer flow but requires full implementation of the spreadsheet functionality and associated backend integrations.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an advanced, high-luxury interior design project management tool, adhering strictly to a black/gold/cream aesthetic and existing spreadsheet structure.

1.  **Customer Intake:** Send a personalized email linked to a beautiful, multi-section Comprehensive Client Questionnaire. The form must auto-create , , and starter  entries upon submission.
2.  **Walkthrough Sheet:** Must support offline/mobile use for on-site data entry. Features required: pre-loaded room/item structures, dynamic editing (add/delete/rearrange rooms/items), and integrated picture/measurement tools (Leica D5 future plan).
3.  **Checklist Sheet (Curation):** Must handle the sourcing phase. Key features: Web scraping from product links (populating details like SKU, cost, image), status linking to pie charts, Canva integration for design boards, and Microsoft Teams notifications.
4.  **FFE Sheet (Logistics/Bible):** The final project tracker. Must include features for **LIVE SHIPPING TRACKING** (via major carriers), order dates, carrier selection, and status updates for installation readiness.
5.  **Unified Search Engine (Planned):** A single view to aggregate and filter scraped products from vendors like Houzz Pro.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS (enforcing strict luxury color palette: black, gold/cream).
-   **Backend/DB:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (), utilizing UUIDs for primary keys.
-   **Core Logic:** CRUD operations for Project, Room, and Item schemas.
-   **Integrations:** Planned Web scraping (Checklist), Canva API, Microsoft Teams API, Shipping Carrier Tracking API (FFE).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack configuration with key logic centralized in specific frontend components based on user requirements (the Exact naming convention).



**Key Files and Status:**
-   **:** Currently holds the comprehensive, multi-section questionnaire logic, including the required backend API calls for creating initial Projects, Rooms, and Starter Items (e.g., 'Seating - Click to edit', 'Wall Finish - Click to edit'). This is confirmed correct.
-   **:** Restored to the correct luxury marketing page that links to the Questionnaire. This is confirmed correct.
-   **:** This component, crucial for curation and scraping, was incorrectly modified and subsequently reverted. It currently holds the stable, pre-feature-addition version. Its intended functionality (demonstrated in ) includes scraping links, vendor tracking, and status management.
-   **:** Contains the logic for the final logistics sheet, including status/carrier updates and live tracking button functionality. This file is currently implemented and stable.
-   **:** Contains basic API endpoints for projects, rooms, and items, crucial for data persistence and the frontend components' functionality (e.g., status updates, bulk item creation).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement Checklist Functionality:** Integrate the precise scraping, Canva linking, and Curation phase logic into .
-   **Backend Integration:** Implement the  endpoint required by the Checklist for product data retrieval.
-   **FFE Live Tracking Update:** Enhance  to correctly handle tracking number input and update the backend model.

<current_work>
The immediate work before this summary was dedicated to stabilizing the application's core presentation layers following user complaints about incorrect code and aesthetics.

1.  **Customer Flow Stabilization:** The  and the comprehensive  (the multi-section, luxury form) are correctly implemented and verified against the user's expectations. This ensures the first step of the workflow—data ingestion and project initialization—is functionally and aesthetically sound.
2.  **Spreadsheet Review:** The three spreadsheet components (, , and ) were reviewed. After a confusing mix-up, the Checklist component was reverted to a stable state. The AI then created conceptual files (, , etc.) to define the exact feature set planned for each sheet:
    *   **Walkthrough:** Basic item management, status updates.
    *   **Checklist (Curation):** Focus on item image/cost/SKU capture,  buttons, and Canva linking.
    *   **FFE (Logistics):** Focus on  selection,  number management, and  button functionality for live shipment tracking.

The current state is ready to move past aesthetics and into implementing the complex, high-value integrations required for the Checklist (scraping) and FFE (tracking).

<optional_next_step>
Implement the core scraping logic and UI elements for the Checklist component, ensuring  handles product link scraping as planned in .
