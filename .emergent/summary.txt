The trajectory details the development of a complex interior design management application, focusing heavily on a challenging feature: automating furniture import from a Canva board. The initial work involved fixing core application functionalities, such as enabling project editing by adding a backend PUT endpoint () and wiring it to the frontend ().

The primary focus then shifted to the Canva import feature, which proved to be a significant technical hurdle due to Canva's aggressive bot detection. The AI engineer attempted multiple scraping strategies with Playwright, encountering security blocks (Just a moment... page). This led to temporary pivots, first to a mock data system and then to a manual entry form, both of which the user rejected, insisting on full automation with their provided Canva link.

A breakthrough occurred when the engineer successfully implemented a more robust browser simulation, extracting 57 furniture URLs from the user's public Canva board. However, this led to the current critical bug: the system successfully scrapes the URLs, creates corresponding items in the MongoDB database with correct names, but fails to link these items to the project's structure. Consequently, the imported items do not appear in the frontend checklist. The root cause was identified as the target project lacking a room structure. Although a Living Room was programmatically created to resolve this, the final test still failed, indicating the data synchronization logic between item creation and project document updates is still flawed. The work has paused at this critical debugging stage.

The goal is to build a technologically advanced, all-in-one interior design management application that automates and streamlines the design workflow.

The core user journey involves several stages:
1.  **Client Onboarding**: A customer-facing questionnaire automatically creates a new project, contact sheet, and a pre-populated Walkthrough sheet.
2.  **Item Curation & Management**: This is the central focus of the recent work. The user requires a seamless way to import furniture items from a Canva presentation board directly into the application's Checklist for a specific project.
3.  **Workflow Automation**: Once an item is imported from Canva into the Checklist, it must also be automatically clipped to the user's Houzz Pro account to maintain a unified catalog.

The key requirement is **full automation**. The user has explicitly rejected manual data entry. The system must be able to access a public Canva URL, extract all embedded furniture product links, scrape data from those vendor links, populate the items into the correct room within the Checklist, and trigger the Houzz Pro clipping process. The current implementation successfully creates the items in the backend database but fails to display them in the UI or clip them to Houzz.

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for the REST API, using Pydantic for data modeling and validation.
- **Database**: MongoDB, accessed asynchronously with the  library.
- **Web Scraping**: Python's Playwright library for advanced browser automation to handle JavaScript-heavy sites and bypass anti-bot measures on Canva and various furniture vendor websites.
- **Deployment**: Services are managed via backend                          RUNNING   pid 41, uptime 0:00:02

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a separate frontend and backend.



- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, containing all FastAPI endpoints. It was heavily modified to support the entire Canva import workflow.
  - **Changes**: A PUT endpoint () was added for project editing. The primary work was building the  endpoint, which orchestrates Playwright-based scraping, data extraction from vendor sites, item creation in MongoDB, and the (currently failing) logic to update the project's room structure with the new items. It was also updated to include a manual import endpoint () as a temporary, now-defunct, workaround.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This component manages the state and layout of the Checklist view, where imported items should appear.
  - **Changes**: This file was significantly refactored to support the room-specific import feature. Logic was added to manage the state of which room's import modal is open () and to pass the necessary handlers down to the spreadsheet component. The global Canva import button was removed.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Renders the detailed checklist, organized by rooms and categories.
  - **Changes**: A room-specific import button, **ðŸŽ¨ Import Page**, was added to each room's header. This button is responsible for triggering the  function passed down from , which opens the import modal for that specific room.

- ****
  - **Importance**: A new component created to handle the UI for importing items into a single, specific room.
  - **Changes**: This component was created to provide a focused modal experience. It includes fields for the Canva URL and page number and makes the API call to the  endpoint. It was later modified to include a toggle for the (now unused) Manual Entry feature.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Checklist UI Update**: The primary bug. Imported items are created in the database but are not correctly appended to the project's room structure, so they never appear in the frontend checklist.
- **Implement Real Houzz Pro Clipping**: The current implementation only simulates clipping to Houzz Pro. The actual integration needs to be built to fulfill the user's core requirement.
- **Stabilize Canva Scraping**: The Playwright-based scraping successfully extracted 57 URLs once but is likely brittle and may fail again due to Canva's bot detection. The process needs to be made more robust and reliable.

<current_work>
The most recent work focuses on debugging a critical flaw in the Canva-to-Checklist workflow. The AI engineer successfully implemented a complex scraping mechanism that extracts furniture URLs from the user's public Canva board and creates corresponding items in the database. The user confirmed that the item names are correct, but reported, nothing loads in the checklist or houzz.

Investigation revealed that while the items are persisted in the  collection, they are not being correctly linked to the main  document. The AI engineer hypothesized this was due to the target project lacking any rooms. A complete Living Room structure, with categories and subcategories, was then programmatically created for the test project.

However, a final test to import items into this newly structured project still failed to display them in the checklist. The work is currently paused at this exact point: needing to debug the database update logic in  that is supposed to find the correct room and category within the project document and append the newly created item's ID. The item creation is successful, but the crucial step of linking it to the project fails silently.

<optional_next_step>
I will add detailed logging to the backend's project update logic within the Canva import endpoint to trace the exact query being used to find the room and category, and inspect why the  operation is failing to add the new items to the project structure.
