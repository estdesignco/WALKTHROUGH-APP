The trajectory details the iterative and often challenging development of a Unified Furniture Search engine for an interior design firm. The project began with a broad set of requirements for a comprehensive design management tool. The core of the work, however, focused on the user's dream feature: a central, searchable catalog of all furniture items from their preferred trade vendors.

The development was marked by a significant, recurring misunderstanding of the primary data population mechanism. The AI engineer initially built a webhook system, then pivoted to a mass-scraping solution for vendor websites, followed by a bot to automate the Houzz Pro clipper, and finally an interceptor script. All these approaches were incorrect. The user's intent, clarified through multiple frustrated messages, was to use their *existing* Houzz Pro clipper workflow as the engine. The data clipped to Houzz Pro should be simultaneously dropped off and stored in the application's database.

After numerous failed attempts to interfere with the clipper extension directly, the project pivoted to a more viable strategy proposed by the user: mirroring/scraping the items that have *already* been saved to the user's Houzz Pro account from specific board and item collection URLs.

Throughout this process, the UI for the search feature was significantly refined based on user feedback, evolving from a simple spreadsheet-style table to a visually rich, brand-aligned online catalog with large product images, which the user ultimately approved. The backend infrastructure (API, database) to support this feature is now robust and tested.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a bespoke Unified Furniture Catalog for an interior design firm. This application must serve as a central, internal search engine for all furniture products clipped from the firm's various trade-only vendor websites (e.g., Four Hands, Visual Comfort).

The primary workflow is as follows:
1.  The designer uses their existing Houzz Pro browser clipper extension to save products from vendor websites to their Houzz Pro account.
2.  The application must then access and ingest this data from the user's Houzz Pro account, effectively mirroring their saved items.
3.  This data, including multiple images, product name, SKU, price, dimensions, and vendor, is stored in a local database.
4.  The application must provide a sophisticated search interface that allows designers to instantly find any clipped product from any vendor in one place.
5.  The UI must be a beautiful online catalog focused on large, prominent product images, styled to match the firm's existing aesthetic of black, gold, and dark blue gradients, rather than a simple data table.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS for a highly bespoke, aesthetic-driven UI.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, serving a RESTful API.
- **Database**: MongoDB, accessed asynchronously via the  library.
- **Data Acquisition**: The current and final strategy is web scraping of a logged-in user session on  using a browser automation tool like Playwright to mirror existing product data. Previous (abandoned) concepts included webhooks and direct browser extension interception.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file. It initializes the app and includes the API router from .
    -   **Changes**: It was edited to correctly include the furniture search router with the required  prefix.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the core backend logic for the furniture catalog. It defines the Pydantic data models for furniture items and contains all API endpoints for adding, searching, deleting, and getting statistics about the catalog items. The  endpoint resides here and has been tested successfully.
    -   **Changes**: The file was created and heavily modified. Search logic was fixed to handle query parameters correctly. Endpoints for stats and vendor/category lists were added to power the UI dashboard. The new Houzz Pro mirroring/scraping logic will be triggered from and integrated with this module.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that handles application-level state and routing.
    -   **Changes**: The routing was updated to replace a legacy  component with the new, correct  component for the  path.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the complete, user-facing component for the dream feature. It contains the UI for the search/filter controls, statistics dashboard, quick category filters, and the visual product catalog grid.
    -   **Changes**: This file has undergone multiple complete rewrites. It evolved from a basic table layout to a spreadsheet-style view, and finally to the user-approved online catalog with a dark blue/gold theme, large image cards, and action buttons. It handles all state management and API calls for searching and displaying products. It also includes buttons to trigger test scrapes and the (future) mass-clipping bot.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the web scraper to log into the user's Houzz Pro account using the provided credentials.
- The scraper must navigate to the two specified URLs: the Selections board and the My Items collection.
- The scraper needs to extract all relevant product data (images, name, SKU, vendor, price, dimensions, etc.) for each item found at those URLs.
- Integrate the scraper's output with the existing backend API to save the scraped products into the MongoDB database.

<current_work>
The project has just undergone a critical and final strategic pivot. All previous attempts to populate the furniture catalog database—via direct webhook interception, mass vendor scraping, and automated clipper bots—have been abandoned after proving unworkable and failing to meet the user's core requirement of using their *actual* Houzz Pro clipper workflow.

The current and agreed-upon approach is to **mirror the data that already exists in the user's Houzz Pro account**. The user has provided two specific URLs: one for a Selections board and one for their general My Items library.

The immediate task is to build a backend scraper using a tool like Playwright. This scraper will:
1.  Use the credentials the user provided ().
2.  Log in to .
3.  Navigate to the two specified URLs.
4.  Extract all product data (images, details, etc.) from those pages.
5.  Post that data to the existing, fully functional backend endpoints to populate the unified furniture catalog.

The frontend UI has been fully developed to the user's satisfaction, featuring a beautiful online catalog aesthetic, and is ready to display the data once it is successfully scraped and stored.

<optional_next_step>
I will begin implementing the Houzz Pro scraper in a new Python file. The first step will be to use Playwright to automate the login process to  with the user's credentials and verify a successful login.
