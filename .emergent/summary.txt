The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two major streams: Houzz Pro Clipper Automation & Unified Search Integration, and Core Application Integration & Styling Restoration (Walkthrough-App). Initially, the Houzz integration was non-functional; the AI debugged it extensively, installed , fixed frontend display logic, corrected API data types, handled  values, and secured user credentials for auto-login. A crucial discovery was leveraging the official Houzz clipper for mass imports. The Unified Furniture Search Engine was also re-integrated and styled.

Simultaneously, the AI addressed user frustration over lost styling and functionality by integrating components from  (advanced features) and other beautiful interfaces (, ). This involved significant backend merging (e.g., , ), frontend component integration, and extensive debugging of React Router, Pydantic validation, and environment variable issues. The AI struggled to maintain the *exact* original styling and functionality, leading to user dissatisfaction, but ultimately restored core  components and styling. The trajectory concludes with all necessary source code acquired for a final selective merge.

<product_requirements>
The user, an interior designer, required a comprehensive application to manage design projects, streamline product sourcing, and integrate with external tools, centered on a luxury black/gold/cream aesthetic.

Key features implemented and explicitly requested:
1.  **Unified Search Engine**: A central platform for multi-vendor product search, evolved to use Houzz's official clipper for legal, mass catalog import into Houzz Pro and the app, including secure credential management and advanced filtering (vendor, category, price, size, color, material, style).
2.  **Canva Integration**: One-click addition of scraped product images with links to Canva project boards.
3.  **Houzz Pro Integration**: Automation to interact with Houzz's web clipper for one-click product addition, auto-filling details, applying markup, and organizing products.
4.  **Customer Questionnaire System**: An elegant email-based client questionnaire with a beautiful customer-facing UI, automatic project creation, and data flow to designer dashboards, contact, and walkthrough sheets.
5.  **Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E Dashboards**: Advanced, visually consistent spreadsheet-like interfaces for project management, on-site walkthroughs, product curation, and final specification. These demanded precise preservation of their original structure, colors, and operations, with offline and mobile app support.
6.  **Teams Integration**: To-do list integration with Microsoft Teams for staff notifications.

The user emphasized strict adherence to the existing aesthetic and functional integrity of the core sheets.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a MERN-stack-like architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI (Python) backend using MongoDB.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles product scraping and Houzz/Canva integration with  browser automation.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented  for Houzz Pro clipper automation, including auto-login, form filling, and submission logic. Debugged the  method, fixed  type mismatch, and securely integrated user credentials. Configured  for headless mode.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application for all backend services.
    -   **Changes**: Debugged extensively after integrating . Fixed  by mapping  to uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) for MongoDB documents. Added comprehensive  value handling for Pydantic models in project creation/retrieval to prevent validation errors.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables like , , and sensitive credentials (Houzz Pro, Canva).
    -   **Changes**: Created and populated with , , and user-provided Houzz/Canva login credentials for authentication in browser automation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines React application routes and global component imports.
    -   **Changes**: Constantly modified for React Router configuration, including customer questionnaire, project system, and search engine routes. Explicitly restored from  to resolve styling and routing conflicts, then adapted to include new features while preserving the original structure.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main designer dashboard, listing projects and key actions.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to display backend projects, integrate , and support various action buttons (New Client, Email New Client, Full Questionnaire, Furniture Search). Underwent multiple styling fixes to achieve the luxury black/gold/cream theme and apply  branding, including gradient backgrounds and gold accents. Corrected button state management and New Client modal enum values.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The primary React component for the unified product search.
    -   **Changes**: Re-integrated and styled to match the dark theme and branding. Displayed product cards, vendor/category filters, and the Houzz Pro clipper button, initially with hardcoded sample products, then refined with real Four Hands product data.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core workflow components for project management.
    -   **Changes**: These were directly copied *exactly* from the  repository, along with many supporting UI components (, , , , etc.), to ensure precise replication of the user's desired functionality and original styling.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully acquired the source code for three distinct systems:  (the current application, now running),  (a GitHub repository), and  (a ZIP file). These were cloned/extracted into the  environment. This was a direct response to the user's explicit instruction to *selectively merge* components from these sources: the beautiful questionnaire and landing pages from , the exact original Walkthrough, Checklist, and FF&E dashboards from , and the search engine from . The engineer just finished installing  to extract the  ZIP file. The previous work involved extensive debugging of routing, backend Pydantic models (fixing  for  vs. uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) and  value handling), and frontend styling to restore the desired luxury theme and branding across the Studio Dashboard and specific components. The Houzz Pro Clipper automation is functional in headless mode but faces login challenges due to Houzz's security.
