The previous AI engineer focused heavily on UI/UX enhancements, particularly adopting a luxury black/gold/cream theme, and addressing persistent web scraping issues. A significant portion of the work involved iterative adjustments to layout, spacing, borders, shimmer effects, and button styling across various frontend components (spreadsheets, dashboards, and questionnaire pages). Playwright browser instability caused recurring scraping failures. Data transfer functionalities were verified. A key challenge was identifying the correct React component for styling, leading to multiple attempts and debugging sessions for questionnaire pages (, , ). The engineer also configured Teams integration and removed redundant UI elements.

The Interior Design Project Management App aims to streamline interior design workflows through three core spreadsheet modules: Walkthrough, Checklist, and FFE. The Walkthrough module supports offline item management and transfer. The Checklist module features robust web scraping for product details (SKU, name, price, image, size, finish/color), status dropdowns for Teams integration, Canva automation, and a PICKED status. The FFE module enables live shipping tracking and direct contentEditable fields. A critical requirement is that rooms auto-populate with full structures upon creation across all sheets. Cross-cutting concerns include sheet independence (except for transfers), reliable Walkthrough to Checklist transfers (only *checked* items, default BLANK status), matching UI colors for dropdowns, and correct Add new category functionality. The app currently has core APIs, a React UI, stabilized data transfers, basic web scraping, and UI styling. Recent work focused on fixing scraping, auto-population, and extensive UI refinements towards a luxury black/gold/cream theme. User also requested integrations with Houzz Pro and Leica D5 for measurements, and CUSTOMER FACING stuff implementation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on applying the new black/gold/cream luxury theme to the questionnaire pages. After much iteration and confusion about which questionnaire component was actually being rendered, it was identified that  (the component displaying a *filled-out* questionnaire) was the one currently showing the old styling. The engineer began updating  to incorporate  and apply the consistent styling (dark elevated containers with rounded corners and shadows, gold borders/accents, cream text on dark backgrounds, gold text on light backgrounds, subdued gold/brown buttons). The  and  sub-components within  were also updated for new colors and styling. The last action was successfully wrapping the entire  component with  and restarting services, with a screenshot taken to verify.
