# ðŸ“± Mobile App - LOCAL SETUP (Run on Your Computer)

Since the Expo dev server needs direct network access to your phone, **the easiest way is to run it on your local computer** instead of the remote server.

## ðŸš€ Quick Local Setup (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed ([download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- Expo Go app on your phone (from App Store/Play Store)

### Step 1: Download the Mobile App Code

**Option A: Via Git (if you have access)**
```bash
# Clone or pull your repository
git pull origin main
cd mobile
```

**Option B: Download Files Directly**

I'll create a zip file you can download:

```bash
# On the server (already done for you)
cd /app
tar -czf mobile-app.tar.gz mobile/
```

You can download: `https://designflow-master.preview.emergentagent.com/mobile-app.tar.gz`

Then extract it on your computer:
```bash
tar -xzf mobile-app.tar.gz
cd mobile
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or if you have yarn:
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Start the App
```bash
npx expo start
```

This will:
- Start the Metro bundler
- Show a QR code in your terminal
- Open a browser with the QR code

### Step 4: Connect Your Phone
1. Open **Expo Go** app on your phone
2. **iPhone**: Use Camera app to scan QR code
3. **Android**: Use Expo Go to scan QR code
4. Wait for app to load (30-60 seconds first time)

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Web Version

Expo also supports running the app in your web browser for quick testing (photos/Bluetooth won't work, but you can see the UI):

```bash
cd mobile
npx expo start --web
```

Opens in your browser at `http://localhost:19006`

## âš¡ Fastest Option: I'll Build a Web Demo

Since the mobile app is React Native + Expo, I can also create a **web version** that runs directly in your browser (without phone) for quick UI testing.

Would you like me to:
1. **Create a web version** you can test in browser right now? (5 min)
2. **Create a downloadable package** you can run locally? (requires Node.js)
3. **Try another tunnel service** to make the remote server work? (may be unstable)
