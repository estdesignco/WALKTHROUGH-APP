# 📧 GMAIL APP PASSWORD SETUP - QUICK GUIDE

## 🚨 URGENT: Gmail Requires App Password (Not Regular Password)

Your regular password `Zeke1919$$$$$` won't work with Gmail SMTP because Gmail requires **App Passwords** when 2-Factor Authentication is enabled (which is standard in 2025).

## ⚡ STEP-BY-STEP SETUP (5 minutes):

### 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled)
- Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/
- Click "Security" → "2-Step Verification"
- Follow the setup if needed

### 2. Generate App Password
- Stay in Google Account Security: https://myaccount.google.com/security
- Scroll to "How you sign in to Google"
- Click "App passwords" (you may need to verify identity)
- Select "Mail" for app type
- Select "Other (Custom name)" and enter: `Interior Design App`
- Click "Generate"

### 3. Copy the 16-Character Password
- Google will show a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
- **COPY THIS ENTIRE PASSWORD** (including spaces)

### 4. Tell Me the App Password
Once you have it, just give me the 16-character App Password and I'll update the system immediately!

1. ✅ Update the backend configuration (30 seconds)
