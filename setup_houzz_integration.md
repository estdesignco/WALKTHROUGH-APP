# HOUZZ PRO CLIPPER INTEGRATION SETUP

## EXACTLY what you asked for! ðŸŽ‰

Your existing Houzz Pro clipper will work normally BUT also "drop off" data in your unified search database.

## STEP 1: Install the Interceptor Script

### Option A: Browser Extension (Recommended)
1. Open Chrome Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Console" tab  
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `/app/houzz_clipper_interceptor.js`
4. Press Enter to run it

### Option B: Bookmark (Persistent)
1. Create a new bookmark in Chrome
2. Set the URL to: `javascript:(function(){[PASTE THE ENTIRE SCRIPT HERE]})();`
3. Click the bookmark on any furniture page before clipping

### Option C: Browser Extension (Advanced)
1. Create a Chrome extension that injects the script
2. Install it permanently

## STEP 2: How It Works

1. **Use Houzz Pro Clipper Normally:**
   - Go to fourhands.com, reginaandrew.com, etc.
   - Find products you want
   - Click your Houzz Pro clipper extension as usual

2. **Automatic Data Interception:**
   - Our script intercepts the clipper data
   - Sends it to: `https://design-import-tool.preview.emergentagent.com/api/furniture/houzz-webhook`
   - Product gets saved to Houzz Pro AND your database

3. **Search Your Clipped Products:**
   - Go to `/furniture-search` in your app
   - Search all your clipped furniture in one place!

## STEP 3: Webhook Endpoints Ready

âœ… **Main Webhook:** `/api/furniture/houzz-webhook`
âœ… **Manual Test:** `/api/furniture/manual-webhook-test`  
âœ… **Search API:** `/api/furniture/furniture-catalog/search`

## STEP 4: Testing

1. **Manual Test on Any Product Page:**
   ```javascript
   testFurnitureClip()
   ```

2. **Check Your Database:**
   - Visit `/furniture-search`
   - Click "SEARCH" to see all clipped products
   - Use category buttons for quick filtering
