## 📋 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the **Canva Scanner Chrome Extension v2.0** with intelligent trade vendor detection, completely rewritten UI matching your app's aesthetic, and comprehensive user documentation.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🔍 **1. Smart Chrome Extension Scanning**

#### Core Functionality:
- **5-Method Scanning System:**
  1. Text content scanning for embedded URLs
  2. HTML anchor tag (`<a>`) link detection
  3. Data attribute scanning (Canva-specific)
  4. Image-with-link parent detection
  5. Inline style background URL scanning

- **Trade Vendor Intelligence:**
  - Pre-configured with 20+ trade vendor domains from your list:
    - Lounards, Bernhardt, Gabby, Visual Comfort, Lola Hug
    - HVL Group, Globe Views, Safavieh, Surya, Eichholtz
    - Have Furniture, 1ow Decor, Base Liminar, Regina Andrew
    - Arteriors Home, Vanguard Furniture, Hinkley
    - Hubbardton Forge, Elegant Lighting, and more
  - **Open-ended detection:** Also intelligently identifies NEW trade vendors

- **Smart Filtering:**
  - ✅ **Accepts:** Product pages with patterns like `/product/`, `/item/`, `/furniture/`, `/lighting/`
  - ❌ **Rejects:** Retail sites (Wayfair, Crate & Barrel, West Elm, etc.)
  - ❌ **Rejects:** Non-product pages (login, cart, account, homepage)

#### Key Improvements from Previous Version:
- Fixed the critical issue where extension was picking up retail "NPC" links
- Now ONLY scans trade vendor product links (exactly what you need!)
- Multiple scanning methods ensure no links are missed
- Real-time console logging for debugging

  ```
- **Gold Text:** All text in `#D4A574` (your signature gold)
- **Gold Borders:** Input fields, buttons, and sections outlined in gold
- **Animated Scan Button:** Pulsing gold gradient effect
- **Status Console:** Dark background with color-coded messages:
  - 🟢 Success: `#9ACD32`

  - ⚪ Info: `#D4A574`

#### Main App Integration:

- **Price tracking:** Alert when prices change
- **Availability monitoring:** Check stock status
